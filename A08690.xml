            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For he well peceiueth, that ſo long as this ſpirituall houſe, and glorious building, ſtandeth firmely and ſurely grounded and founded vpon Chriſt, the euerlaſting truth, the way and the life, contained in the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles; which they not only haue deliuered to the Church by liuely voice: But as the faithfull Pen-men, Notaries, and Secretaries of the Holy Ghoſt, haue alſo regiſtred, and committed to writing in the ſacred Scriptures (for the continuall comfort and inſtruction thereof:)
<note place="margin">Matt. 7.24,25.</note> it remaineth vnremoueable and inuincible againſt hell gates, and all the ſtormes and tempeſts raiſed againſt it by him, and all his inſtruments.
<note place="margin">Iohn 8.44.</note> Wherefore he layeth all his battery, and bendeth all his forces againſt this foundation, labouring by falſhood and lyes, whereof he is the father, to corrupt, depriue, alter, obſcure and deface the Gospell of Chriſt, and the word of life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſubuert and ouerturne, or at leaſt, to weaken and ſhake the faith of the faithfull, reſting wholly thereupon.

Here-hence is it that the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth the <hi>Galathians, Not to beleeue an Angell comming from heauen; but rather to hold him accurſed, if hee ſhould teach vnto them any other doctrine, than that which at his mouth they had receiued.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>

            <p>But to omit their monſtrous and manifold errours drawn from the ſinckes and puddles of all former Heretickes, wherewith this confuſed and huge <hi>Babel</hi> of this <hi>Romiſh Antichriſtian</hi> kingdom hath beene builded vp: the meanes, and inſtruments whereby the ſame hath bin brought to paſſe, are the hypocriticall ſwarmes of Popiſh <hi>Monks, Friers, Ieſuits,</hi> and ſuch other irreligious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: But eſpecially the ſame is to be ſeene at this day in the new, and lately inuented ſects of the <hi>Ieſuits, Capuchins,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Mendicant Friers;</hi> which the <hi>Romiſh Antichriſt</hi> hath ſet forth as the laſt proppe and ſtay of his tottering and ruinous king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for he perceiuing that (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath foreſhewed) Chriſt hath begun to conſume it, with the breath of his mouth, and aboliſh it with the brightneſſe of his comming, that is, the preaching of the Goſpell: And ſeeing moreouer the world to grow to a diſliking &amp; contempt of the ignorance, ſluggiſhneſſe, &amp; lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the other Orders of

               <hi>Swethland</hi> and other Countries of Chriſtendome. Furthermore, he vſeth this ſpeciall policy, to cauſe them by all meanes, priuily to allure and entice the youths of the Vniuerſities and Countries where the Goſpell is preached, to depart from the places where they are, vnto his Colleges, Seminaries and Cloiſters, to the end that being there for a time nuzled, and trained vp vntill they bee hardened in hypocriſie, obſtinacie, and malice againſt the truth; and poiſoned with the peſtilent errours of the Romiſh Synagogue: they may be ſent out as new falſe Apoſtles into their owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or elſe thither, where it is thought they may doe moſt harme.

I dare giue them a paire of ſiluer Eyes to be offered to the blacke woodden Lady of <hi>Loretto,</hi> if they can finde in the Bible that either <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his Apoſtles did euer know or teach, that whoſoeuer ſhould die in a <hi>Gray-friers</hi> habit, ſhould neuer come into <hi>Purgatory:</hi> or that Saint <hi>Francis</hi> is placed in

<hi>Popes</hi> haue ſet vp, not only without, but alſo againſt the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And yet I name not the <hi>Popes</hi> themſelues, their
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, Prelates, Patriarkes,</hi> and ſuch like beaſts, whereof neither the Apoſtles or Prophets euer heard of; nay I dare boldly ſay, that if the Apoſtles or Prophets had but once ſeene or heard the hundreth part of theſe new Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders named, they would haue beene afraid of them. For, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could not ſuffer, that among the
<hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> ſome ſhould call themſelues the diſciples of
<hi>Peter,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <pb n="4" facs="tcp:14140:7"/> of <hi>Paul,</hi> and others of
<hi>Apollo:</hi> how would he haue been then afraid and out of quiet, to haue ſeene and heard of ſuch an innumerable company of new and diuers names, Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Religions, and Rules of perfection, ſome clad in black, ſome in white, ſome in gray, greene, blew, ſome in red, and ſome in furres, &amp;c. And euery one to eſteeme his owne Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Rules for the beſt, and moſt worthy to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he would ſurely haue thought himſelfe to be in a new world. Therefore the holy Father the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers,</hi> yea all his Clergie men, will not haue men to found themſelues, or depend only vpon that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles haue written and taught, for (ſay they) the world is now altered, and the <hi>Popes</hi> haue found out and eſtabliſhed new Religions, new Commandements, and new Articles of Faith; whereof the Apoſtles neuer heard, or knew of. For otherwiſe (beleeue me) if nothing elſe were eſteemed but the bare Scriptures and writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, then ſhould the Decrees, Decretals, and Ordinances of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Councells which haue beene kept and holden by the Order and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the <hi>Popes;</hi> yea all the before ſpecified Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Religions of <hi>Monks, Friers, Nunnes, Heremites, Gildes</hi> and
<hi>Knight-hoods,</hi> be vtterly ouerthrowne: yea all their pretended
<hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Supererogations, Prayers to Saints, Purgatory,</hi> and ſuch like trumperies, would not be worth a rotten Apple. If men (I ſay) would begin to eſteeme the holy Scripture alone, for a true and ſufficient rule and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to attaine to ſaluation, then ſhould <hi>Luther</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and praiſed for cauſing the Decrees and Decretalls of the
<hi>Pope</hi> to be burned in <hi>Germany,</hi> when his bookes were burned at
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe there are many <hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> and

<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We reade that many religious men heretofore contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the world, and all the pompe, pride, and vanity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, withdrew themſelues into Wilderneſſes and deſart pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>Syria, Egypt,</hi> and other Countries, to the end they might the better (being not troubled with worldly cares and incumbrances) beſtow their time in reading and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying the holy Scriptures, faſting, praying, meditating, and ſuch diuine exerciſes: Whereof <hi>Paul,</hi> (ſurnamed the firſt <hi>Heremite) Anthony, Hilarion, Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Ierome,</hi> were the firſt and chiefeſt among the
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who for their ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of life, were in thoſe daies had in great honour; for <pb n="6" facs="tcp:14140:8"/> then this kinde of life was ſimple and free, and not bound or tied to ſuch vnlawfull Vowes, and ridiculous Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as our moderne Monkes and Friers now adaies pretend to obſerue and keepe. Their Habit was then homely and yet decent, as euery man beſt pleaſed to weare; Neither were they bound, to abide or remaine in any one particular place or Couent, nor tied to one kind of life by vow; but free to ſtay there, where they liked beſt, or to goe vnto any other City or Country where they would at their owne pleaſure: &amp; if that at any time it repented any of them to haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken or entred into that kind of life, it was in his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per power to recant, and withall to returne to his former vocation or calling againe, without any note, or ſigne of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy or ſcandall: which kind of life, if the <hi>Monks</hi> of our time would imitate, we ſhould hold them farre more holy than we doe, or (to ſay the truth) than they are indeed.</p>
               <p>They ſought out the moſt deſart places they could find, that is, in the Wilderneſſe, and therefore were called <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites; (quaſi eremum colentes,</hi> inhabiting in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) which the
<hi>Grecians</hi> call <hi>Anchorites,</hi> becauſe they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued alone without any company, and therefore our <hi>Monks</hi> call themſelues
<hi>Monachus,</hi> that is to ſay, a <hi>ſolitary man:</hi> but by little and little afterwards they began to gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues together, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed. So that in thoſe daies, the <hi>Monks</hi> by their Prayers, Faſting, Watching, Reading, and ſtudying of the holy Scriptures, liuing hardly and far from the company or ſociety of men, working with their owne hands, and getting their liuing with the ſweat of their browes, gaue a ſingular good example to all men to liue verruous and godly; and afterwards thoſe that were firſt gathered together into one Congregation for a long time, following the foot-ſteps of their Predeceſſors, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted their Families, and others that reſorted vnto them, to leade a godly and a Chriſtian life: and were admired and honoured of all good men, for their doctrine, integrity of life and godly zeale: for as yet the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth <pb n="7" facs="tcp:14140:8"/> had but one <hi>Law</hi> and one <hi>Religion;</hi> which now (to the great griefe and ſorrow of all good men) is rent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into ſo many Sects and Factions, Superſtitions, and Ceremonies, that it is a lamentable ſight to ſee or thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the preſent miſery and calamity of the Church.</p>
               <p>There are ſome of our Moderne <hi>Monks</hi> and
<hi>Friers</hi> which affirme, that <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> were the firſt that led a ſolitary life in the Wilderneſſe; and were the Authors or Patrons of their Orders, and therefore would perſwade the world that they doe imitate them; yea, deriue their Rules and Orders from them (of whom I ſhall haue occaſion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to ſpeake in another place) but as the one was greater than a <hi>Prophet;</hi> ſo was the other more, yea farre better than euer any <hi>Monk</hi> or <hi>Frier</hi> was, as our
<hi>Sauiour</hi> himſelfe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth of <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaying, <hi>That among the ſonnes of men there was neuer any one greater than Iohn Baptiſt.</hi> Neuertheleſſe, the <hi>Monks</hi> of the order of Saint
<hi>Anthony</hi> hold it no leſſe than <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> to ſay that any order of <hi>Monks</hi> or <hi>Friers</hi> is more ancient than theirs; and yet thoſe of Saint <hi>Benets</hi> Order doe deny it flatly, and in all Proceſſions or ſolemne mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings doe take the vpper hand and place of them, and of all other diſordered Orders or rable of <hi>Monks,</hi> or
<hi>Friers</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Others there be that think this kinde of <hi>Monaſticall</hi> life to haue beene firſt inſtituted by a ſort of religious men in
<hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> called <hi>Eſſaei</hi> or <hi>Eſſeni,</hi> a Sect in thoſe daies very famous &amp; in great reputation among the

They dwell not in Towns or Cities, imagining, that as the contagion of the aire is hurtfull to the body, ſo the conuerſation of the people to be dangerous to the ſoule. Some of them do till and manure the ground, others doe exerciſe ſome peaceable and quiet trade to his owne profit, and his neighbours good: neither doe they lay vp in ſtore any gold or ſiluer, or poſſeſſe any great Farmes or Liuings; but onely ſo much as is ſufficient to maintaine them. They, of all other men, doe contemne and deſpiſe Lands and Money; holding themſelues to bee richeſt in vertue, and iudging a meane calling, without any great want, the greateſt wealth in the world. None of them doth make any kinde of weapon, either Swords, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, Bucklers, or any other warlike Inſtrument: Neither doe they exerciſe any Art or Trade that is noiſome, or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to any man; they neuer trade or trafficke in Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, or keepe any Inne or Victualing houſe: they know not what Nauigation meaneth, they vſe no manner of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine or deceit. They haue no ſeruants among them, but all are equall and free men, the one ſeruing and aſſiſting the other. The ſeuenth day they repaire to a holy place, which they call a <hi>Synagogue,</hi> the younger ſort ſit beneath the elder, there they reade the Scripture diligently, and expound it truly and ſincerely. They learne to liue godlily, holily, and iuſtly, and haue a threefold rule or order; the firſt, to loue God aboue all things zealouſly; the ſecond, to ſeeke after vertue diligently; and the third, to loue their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours feruently. And that they loue God aboue all things, we may alleage many Arguments, as perpetuall chaſtity, their hatred towards ſwearing and lying, and eſpecially that they confidently beleeue
<hi>God</hi> to be the only Author and efficient cauſe of all good things, and not of any euill thing. And that they ſtudy Vertue may appeare, becauſe they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect money, deſpiſe honour, and hate all voluptuouſneſſe. And laſtly, their beneuolence, ſociety, and equality are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant teſtimonies of their brotherly loue and Charity: for <pb n="9" facs="tcp:14140:9"/> none hath a houſe that is not common to all the reſt, and their money and expences are common. Moreouer, their Apparell, Meat, and Drinke, yea all that they haue is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Hither are the words of <hi>Phylo</hi> cited by
<hi>Euſebius.</hi> Now let our <hi>Monks,</hi> who liue like <hi>Kings,</hi> who ſwim in all manner of delights and pleaſures, who affect nothing more than promotion and honour; and whoſe chiefeſt care and ſtudy is to gather wealth, and hoord vp Gold, Siluer, Pearles, and precious Stones, bee aſhamed that their righteouſneſſe doth not now exceed thoſe
<hi>Eſſaeians</hi> or <hi>Eſſenians,</hi> but doth rather come farre ſhort of theirs.</p>
               <p>But yet moſt of the learned, yea they of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> are of opinion that this Saint <hi>Anthony</hi> was the firſt that inſtituted this <hi>Monaſticall</hi> life, which was in
<hi>Thebaica,</hi> a region in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where he built a
<hi>Monaſterie,</hi> and there together with <hi>Sarmatas, Amatas,</hi> and
<hi>Macharius</hi> his Diſciples, liued many yeeres, ſpending the reſidue of their time in faſting and praying; their food being but Bread, Herbs, and Roots, and their drinke Water. He died in the Wilderneſſe in the yeere of our Lord God <hi>CCCLXI.</hi> being 105. yeeres old.</p>
               <p>Whereby it ſeemes, that this kinde of <hi>Monaſticall</hi> or priuate life was very ancient, and ſuch as the time and eſtate of the Church required then: but that which after in place thereof ſprang vp among vs, was of later time, and being at the firſt farre vnlike the other, the longer it ſtood, did notwithſtanding ſtill degenerate more and more, till at length it grew intolerable.</p>

<hi>Baſil</hi> was the firſt that gaue Rules or Orders vnto <hi>Monks.</hi> Among other Lawes and Statutes, hee ordained, that after that a <hi>Monk</hi> had remained the ſpace of one whole yeere in his Abbey (if ſo be that he was willing to continue there ſtill) hee ſhould make three ſeuerall ſolemne Vowes: firſt to liue <hi>chaſtly,</hi> (but with this

               <p>Againe <hi>Benet</hi> gaue his Monklings a new kinde of fooliſh habit; appointing them alſo a certaine forme of praying;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14140:10"/> allowing them but meane Commons, and withall a new manner of <hi>Abſtinence,</hi> that was likewiſe neuer heard of before.</p>
               <p>But now the world is altered with them; for whoſoeuer will ſuruay or view them well, ſhall ſee that they liue like Princes, and farre more like Epicures than Religious men, as all thoſe that are, or haue beene acquainted with them, can teſtifie.</p>
               <p>This Congregation of Saint <hi>Benet</hi> grew, by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to be ſo great, that it is almoſt incredible. Yet in the end there hapned ſuch a Schiſme among them, that it was and ſtill is diuided into many families, as <hi>Cluniacenſes, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malduenſes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alliſumbrenſes, Montoliuetenſes, Grandimon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes, Ciſtercienſes, Sylueſtrenſes Coeleſtini,</hi> and diuers others, who are now adaies either vnited with other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or elſe quite extirpated and aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſeuerall Sects of <hi>Monks</hi> (who apply their minds to nothing elſe but to ſloth, idleneſſe, gluttony, idolatry, whordome, fornication, and the like impietie (vnleſſe it be to inuent and bring in daily more new Sects of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi>) are reported to haue proceeded from the firſt Family of Saint <hi>Benet.</hi> Thoſe that were firſt inſtituted by this Saint (as they themſelues confeſſe) are thoſe that now adaies weare a blacke looſe Coat of ſtuffe reaching downe to their heeles, with a Cowle (or hood) to couer their bald Pates, which hangs downe to their ſhoulders; and their <hi>Scapular</hi> ſhorter than any other of theſe <hi>Monks;</hi> and vnder that Coat another white Habit as large as the former, made of Stuffe or white Flannen. They ſhaue the haires of their heads, except one little round circle which they leaue round about their heads, which they call <hi>Corona,</hi> their Crowne forſooth, becauſe they would bee honoured as Kings and Princes. By the rule that their Patron gaue them, they are bound to abſtaine perpetually from fleſh, vnleſſe, when they are ſicke. And therfore theſe immodeſt moderne <hi>Monks</hi> (who doe eat Fleſh daily, except the time of

Where you may obſerue that this Monaſticall Inſtitution, being but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and not grounded or warranted by the Word of God, did not continue long inuiolated; the nature of men being inclined (yea in the beſt things) to wax daily rather worſe than better. And therefore the <hi>Benedictin Monks</hi> haue contaminated their former Piety and Deuotions with the Mammon of this world, as Promotions, Sloth, Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, and all manner of Luxury; which was the cauſe that this one Family was ſo rent and diuided into ſo many Sects and Schiſmes as daily experience teacheth vs. How religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly they haue liued heretofore, and ſtill liue, thoſe that are conuerſant in their owne Hiſtories, and haue trauelled in forraigne Countries, can beſt tell, to their perpetuall ſhame; although our new vpſtart Engliſh <hi>Benedictin Monks</hi> would haue the world beleeue that their Order firſt planted the Chriſtian Religion in this Land, and that the <hi>Monks</hi> of their Order were euer godly and religious men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be ranked with the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> who are great Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for they (good <hi>Monks</hi>) meddle not with matters of State, or with Kings affaires: but for all their counterfeit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe let me tell them in their eares, that an Engliſh <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictin</hi> of

<hi>Bethlem,</hi> where hee liued many yeares in faſting, praying, and writing, whoſe diuine workes are ſtill extant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many other men afterwards, by imitation indeuouring to lead that kinde of ſolitary life, called themſelues <hi>Hierony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miani</hi> or <hi>Ieronymiti,</hi> but (alas) they were farre contrary to him ether in life, diſcipline or doctrine. From Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> (or to ſay the truth, from theſe
<hi>Hieronymiani</hi>) the <hi>Ieromite Monks</hi> doe borrow, or vſurpe their firſt origine or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and doe pretend (though moſt falſly) that this great Doctor was the only man that firſt erected their Order, and gaue them their Rule. They weare a kinde of a ſandy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14140:14"/> habite downe to their heeles, and a cloke of the ſame colour, likewiſe to the ground: ſome of them weare ſhooes and ſtockins; and others, that are more hypocriticall, weare ſandales. They haue great Abbeyes and large poſſeſſions, and abound in wealth, whereſoeuer they liue. And their chiefeſt dwelling is in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> for in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries they haue but a few or no Monaſteries at all. The truth is, one <hi>Carolus Granellus,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> was the firſt Author of this Sect, who liued many yeares after Saint <hi>Ierome;</hi> and he was the firſt that built an Abbey for them in the hilles of
<hi>Feſſulana</hi> in <hi>Italy:</hi> howbeit, there are others that attribute this Inſtitution to <hi>Redo,</hi> Earle of <hi>Montegranello,</hi> and that they obſerued at the firſt the Rule or Order of Saint

               <p>THere are diuers opinions among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> concerning the firſt originall or beginning of theſe <hi>Canon Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi>

<hi>Auguſtine</hi> was neuer the Author or Founder of either of theſe two Sects, or of any other Order of <hi>Friers.</hi> Neuertheleſſe, theſe
<hi>Canon Regulars</hi> doe not only affirme that Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> when he was <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Hippo</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> did reduce all the <hi>Canons</hi> of that Church to this order and diſcipline that they now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to obſerue: But alſo ſome of them doe very impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bragge, that their Order was inſtituted by the Apoſtles before Saint
<hi>Auguſtines</hi> time, and that this holy man did but renew it, and did neuer inſtitute any other Religious Order beſides theirs. The <hi>Mendican Auguſtine Friers</hi> doe ſtoutly deny it; and ſay that their Order, and none other, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by this great <hi>Doctor,</hi> as hereafter ſhall be declared.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Canon Regulars</hi> doe weare long white cloth coats, open before, downe to their heeles; vnderneath they weare doublets, breeches, ſhirts, and white ſtockins, ſhooes or ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Ouer this coat (which is bound with a girdle) they doe weare a ſhort ſurplice to their knees, and ouer that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhort blacke cloake to their elbowes (like a womans ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cloake) with a little cowle or hood faſtened to it, and a blacke corner-cap, or a broad hat, when they walke or goe abroad; and their crownes ſhauen like other <hi>Friers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They haue great <hi>Monaſteries</hi> like <hi>Princes Courts,</hi> and great lands and reuenues, and are very rich. And haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cloiſters in <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Netherland;</hi> but in
<hi>France, Spaine,</hi> and other Catholike Countries, they haue not ſo many. Moreouer, they are diuided into many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as <hi>Canonici Saluatoris,</hi> and <hi>Scopetini,</hi> whoſe Authors were <hi>Iacobus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus Senenſes.</hi> This Order did <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the eleuenth approue and confirme, about the yeare 1408.

<hi>Franciſcus Bononienſis</hi> was the firſt Inſtitutor of this Sect, in the time of <hi>Pope Vrban</hi> the fifth, in the yeare 1366. and the other two did but renue it, being almoſt aboliſhed.</p>

               <p>THis Order of Friers is more ancient than all the former Orders, if ye will beleeue them. For they ſay, that <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> Saint
<hi>Peters</hi> Diſciple, and the third Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, was warned by an <hi>Angell</hi> to build for them a houſe to entertaine all thoſe that fled thither for the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſake: which he with all ſpeed performed, ſo that in a ſhort time, many godly men repaired thither and were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, who for many yeeres afterwards bare a Croſſe in their hands in memoriall of the death and paſſion of our Sauiour. A thing vnlike to be true, that <hi>Clytus</hi> ſhould bee warned by an
<hi>Angell</hi> to build a houſe for a company of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie <hi>Friers,</hi> to entertaine all thoſe that fled to <hi>Rome</hi> for the Chriſtian Religion ſake; whereas the very name of <hi>Monks</hi> or <hi>Friers</hi> was not then, or many hundred yeeres after ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowne or heard of in the Church of God. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the perſecution was then ſo great in <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Saints themſelues were conſtrained to forſake the City, and therefore it is not credible that other Chriſtians ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire thither for reliefe and ſuccour in their diſtreſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</p>
               <p>There are others of opinion, that one <hi>Cyriacus</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> (and he whom they report to haue ſhewed
<hi>S. Helen, Conſtantine</hi> the Great's Mother, where the Croſſe was whereon our bleſſed <hi>Sauiour</hi> was <hi>crucified</hi>) was the firſt that inſtituted this order in memoriall of the inuention of the
<hi>Croſſe:</hi> and that hee gaue order that theſe <hi>Monks</hi> ſhould euer afterwards carry a Croſſe in their hands. And that this
<hi>Cyriacus</hi> was afterwards martyred by <hi>Iulian</hi> the
<hi>Apoſtata,</hi> and therefore their Order became almoſt extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. But Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, about the yeere <pb n="24" facs="tcp:14140:17"/>
1215. did reuiue it againe, and euer ſince it hath flouriſhed. And Pope
<hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond commanded them to weare a skie colour Habit. But now this Order of Friers weare a Croſſe of red cloth or Scarlet fixed to their Habit on their breſt, and weare blacke.

               <p>I Am now come to the <hi>Carthuſian Friers,</hi> whoſe firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was in the yeere 1130. their firſt Founder was one

<hi>Dic mihi quot habes iniquitates;</hi> this <hi>Bruno</hi> being then and there preſent, the dead man cryed out, <hi>Iuſto Dei iudicio damnatus ſum,</hi> that is, I am damned through the iuſt iudgement of God. Whereupon this <hi>Bruno</hi> being ſtrucken with ſuch a feare, beganne to conſider, that if ſuch a good man (as that was, <pb n="28" facs="tcp:14140:19"/> in the iudgement of the world) was damned through the iuſt iudgement of God, what would become of him and many thouſands more, that were farre worſe than that man was in mans iudgement; and therefore with all ſpeed left
<hi>Paris,</hi> and tooke his iourney, together with ſix of his Schollers, to liue ſolitary in ſome Wilderneſſe; and not long after came to the Prouince of <hi>Dolphinè</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> neere to the City
<hi>Gratianopolis</hi> or <hi>Grenoble,</hi> where he obtained a place to build him a <hi>Monaſterie</hi> on the top of a high ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious hill, called
<hi>Carthuſia,</hi> from whence this Family tooke name. This place one
<hi>Hugo,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> gaue them, who afterwards became a religious <hi>Frier</hi> of that Order. They weare a long white cloth Coat looſe, with a Cowle and a long blacke Cloke ouer when they goe abroad, which is but ſeldome, white cloth Stockings, and a haire Shirt (as they ſay) but <hi>credat qui vult,</hi> let him beleeue that will; for mine owne part I beleeue it not.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lay-brothers</hi> (for ſo they call all thoſe that are reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men and no Prieſts) weare a ſhort Coat or Iacket of a reddiſh coloured cloth downe to their knees. They neuer eat Fleſh, Butter, or Cheeſe; but the beſt Fiſh, Egges, Oile, Honey, Fruits, and the pureſt Wine that they can get. They faſt (as they ſay) the ſixt day of the weeke with Bread and Water, to bring the fleſh in ſubiection to the ſpirit. They are enioyned (I meane the Prieſts) to a perpetuall kinde of ſilence, for they muſt not talke or conuerſe one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but at certaine daies in the yeere: none of them are permitted to goe abroad out of their Monaſtery, but the <hi>Prior</hi> and <hi>Procurator,</hi> vnleſſe it be ſome of the <hi>Lay-brethren,</hi> who goe abroad now and then about the affaires of their Cloiſter; for they are very rich and haue great ſtore of lands, corne, cattell, flocks of ſheepe, and heards of goats and ſwine, and many ſeruants. They permit no woman kinde to come within their
<hi>Monaſteries</hi> or <hi>Churches,</hi> leſt with the ſight of them they ſhould bee tempted to luſt for them. Truly it is an excellent thing, if they can keepe the affection <pb n="29" facs="tcp:14140:19"/> of their mindes correſpondent to their outward geſtures, and tame the fleſh by liuing idle and ſolitary; the which Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> (who tooke great paines, and liued a farre more auſtere life than they do) could hardly performe, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe teſtifieth. They neuer eat together but on Sundayes or Feſtiuall dayes, and then euery man hath his ſeuerall portion, but all alike (as the faſhion is among all <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers,</hi>) Euery
<hi>Prieſt, Deacon,</hi> or <hi>Subdeacon</hi> among theſe

<hi>Mechlin</hi> neare <hi>Bruxels;</hi> they are very rich, and were in great hope, when his Maieſtie was in <hi>Spaine,</hi> to haue recouered
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14140:20"/> their Cloiſters and Reuenues in <hi>England.</hi> But now of late, I heare ſay (the more is the pitie) that they, as well as others of our <hi>Engliſh Monks, Friers,</hi> and <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> yea the holy
<hi>Nuns,</hi> are fallen into a conſumption (or rather deſperation) if it be true, I would aduiſe them to ſend for <hi>Don Diego Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mientes, Conde de Gondomar,</hi> to adminiſter phyſicke vnto them: for he is (if I am not much deceiued) the beſt <hi>Doctor</hi> to touch their pulſe, and to purge their ill humors (as for their purſes he hath done it alreadie) and to ſay the truth, he is the man that is beſt acquainted with their diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>All theſe former Orders, or Sects of <hi>Monks</hi> and
<hi>Friers,</hi> doe abound in riches, and doe more reſemble Princes than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men. Their Monaſteries are moſt ſumptuouſly built, and ſituated in the fatteſt ground, and the moſt plentifull fields of the Countrey, neare ſome pleaſant Riuer. Haue they not all the pleaſures that the Country can afford? Doe they not feed on the choiſeſt meat and drink, yea carouſe of the pureſt wine (in bowles and goblets of gold and ſiluer) that can be got for money? Haue they not their Orchards ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the delicateſt fruits that can be had? Oh how are their Gardens contriued with pleaſant walkes, and furniſhed with infinite varietie of ſweet and medicinable herbes and roots, and with moſt curious and coſtly fountaines, ſprings, ſtatues, groues and thickets? Doe they not reſt vpon beds of downe, and pure ſweet linnen? How are their Celles hanged with cloth of Arras, and other curious and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tapiſtrie? Haue they not their white Iſland-dogges, munkies, parots, and other prating birds, to ſport and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create themſelues withall? With what ſtatelineſſe doe they ride abroad in their Caroches, or vpon their great horſes or mules in their foot-cloathes? What reuerence doe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act (or at leaſt-wiſe expect) from all ſorts of people? Haue they not their Monaſteries, Orchards, Gardens, walkes, groues, fountaines, and fiſh-ponds compaſſed about with a high thicke ſtone or bricke wall, to the end that none may diſcouer their ſecret knaueries, or participate of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <pb n="32" facs="tcp:14140:21"/> walkes? Are not their gates alwaies locked, that none can come in, except it be their ſpeciall friends? Haue they not whole Manors, Farmes, Granges, Vineyards, Dayries, and great flockes of ſheepe, herds of cattell, hogs and goats, yea all kinde of poultries, corne, paſtures, and other proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their owne, farre more than will ſerue their turne? How coſtly are their Chalices, Corporas, Copes, Veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and other Church-furniture? In what pompe doth an <hi>Abbot</hi> ſing <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and his <hi>Monks</hi> aſſiſt and ſerue him? To conclude, whereſoeuer there is any Abbey or Priorie, there doe Whores and Bawds dwell and reſort by whole hundreds. And that this is true, all honeſt Trauellers that know <hi>Italy, Spaine, France, Germany, Netherland,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholike Countries, can beare me record. And is this (iudge you) to forſake the world, to mortifie the fleſh, and to ſpend the time in holy meditations and prayers? Or is it not to carry the world, and all the pompe, pleaſures and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcences thereof with them into their Cloiſters and Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries? As their holy Father the
<hi>Pope</hi> would haue <hi>Orbem in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbe, Rome</hi> to containe all the World.</p>
               <p>Hauing treated (though briefly) of the rich <hi>Monks</hi> and
<hi>Friers,</hi> it remains now for me to ſpeake of the <hi>Mendicant,</hi> or begging <hi>Friers:</hi> and laſtly of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> whom (in regard they are ſuch eminent men in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good ſouldiers and ſingular good miners, &amp; well experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in powder plots, and fire-workes) I will place in the reareward of this Regiment of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers,</hi> and in the latter end of this Diſcourſe. I will therefore (according to their antiquitie) begin with the
<hi>Auguſtine Mendicant Friers,</hi> becauſe they challenge the firſt ranke or place among the Begging <hi>Friers:</hi> wherein I ſhall not (as I hope) doe the other <hi>Friers</hi> any wrong, ſeeing that they haue the firſt place of all theſe kinde of <hi>Friers</hi> in all Proceſſions, Burialls, and other Aſſemblies whatſoeuer.</p>

                  </note> They came into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Italy</hi> about the yeare 1252. At which time there began ſuch a grieuous plague at
<hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and ouer all <hi>England,</hi> that the like was neuer knowne before.</p>
               <p>But now to the matter: It is moſt certaine that theſe
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Regulars,</hi> and the <hi>Mendicant Auguſtine Friers,</hi> were both of ſome other mens inſtitution. For many men in thoſe daies (vnder a counterfeit ſhew of piety) did a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the daies of <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> liue for ſome certaine time in wilderneſſes and ſolitary places, and in the end gathered themſelues together into one Family, vnder the name of this holy man, and called themſelues
<hi>Auguſtiniani Eremitani;</hi> becauſe they profeſſed (forſooth) to imitate him in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and rule of life; though indeed they were, and ſtill are meere Hypocrites, and quite contrary to <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in ſanctity of life, learning and Religion. And by this meanes, theſe ſhauelings became to be the firſt Order of the rout of Begging
<hi>Friers,</hi> whereof they are not a little proud.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:14140:22"/>But truly I ſee no reaſon why theſe men ſhould liue thus by the ſweat of other mens browes: for it is well knowne, that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> whom they brag (though vntruly) to be their Patron and firſt Inſtitutor, did not liue idly by beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, as they doe, but was a very painfull man, and a great <hi>Doctor</hi> or Teacher in Gods Church, as his Workes doe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. And withall, it is moſt apparant that our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> did neuer beg; neither did his Apoſtles or Diſciples liue lazily and idly by othermens labours, as Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth of himſelfe, ſaying,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Et laboranimus operantes proprijs manibus; We laboured, working with our owne hands.</hi> And
<hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> got their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with their owne hands, as the <hi>Greeke Monks</hi> doe (for the moſt part) at this inſtant: yea <hi>S. Francis</hi> (whoſe Family or, to ſay more plainly, whoſe Sects are ſpread ouer the face of the earth) would haue his <hi>Friers</hi> get their liuing by their handie worke, as appeares by his laſt Will and Teſtament. But alas, now adayes, it is no leſſe than blaſphemie, to ſay that <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> muſt worke, nay, they hold them no better than Heretickes, that would haue ſuch holy men to follow the inſtitution of the Apoſtle, that is,
<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3.10.</note> 
                  <hi>That hee that would not worke, ſhould not eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Mendicant Auguſtine Friers</hi> doe weare a long white coat of cloth downe to their heeles all looſe, with a cowle or hood of the ſame, when they are in their Cloiſters, but when they goe abroad, they weare another blacke coat ouer the other, with another cowle, both their coats are then bound cloſe to their bodies, with a broad leather girdle or belt, which girdle is a very holy thing, if you will beleeue them; for they call it
<hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> girdle; and many lay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do weare it for pure deuotion ſake, becauſe (forſooth) it hath ſome ſingular great vertue. I haue ſeene many great Princes weare it, namely, Q. <hi>Margaret</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> and others, whom for breuitie ſake I forbeare to name. This leather Belt is giuen to none but vnto thoſe that are their ſpeciall good Benefactors, and ſuch as pay dearely for it, which brings <pb n="35" facs="tcp:14140:22"/> them in no ſmall benefit. Neuertheleſſe, theſe holy Fathers haue beene a long time, not ſo well thought of; becauſe <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Martin Luther</hi> (who was ſometimes a <hi>Frier</hi> of this Order) did reuolt from the Sea of <hi>Rome;</hi> but yet of late they begin to flouriſh againe, and are exceeding rich, eſpecially in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Auguſtine Friers</hi> in <hi>London</hi> (which was built for them by <hi>Humfrey Bohum</hi> Earle of <hi>Hereford</hi> and
<hi>Eſſex</hi>) and many other Cloiſters in <hi>England</hi> did heretofore belong to this Order of <hi>Friers,</hi> and therefore ſome Engliſhmen of late tooke this holy habite, whereof Father <hi>Thomas Witherhead, alias Tomſon, alias Tom Poet, alias Tom Tobacco,</hi> a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet but a <hi>Homunculus,</hi> a man a little bigger than a
<hi>Dwarfe,</hi> was the firſt. A man of an extraordinary great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in chooſing of good <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and no meane <hi>Actor,</hi> as the Children of the Reuells could once tell, and withall a peece of an
<hi>Engliſh Poet;</hi> for <hi>Latine</hi> he had neuer any. This good father receiued this habite of the <hi>Prior</hi> of the <hi>Auguſtin Friers</hi> at
<hi>Louain</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and afterwards was made <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and then ſent into <hi>England,</hi> to conuert (as I thinke)
<hi>Ballad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, Players, Tobacconiſts,</hi> and <hi>Tinckers.</hi> His fatherhood being at <hi>Louain</hi> in his <hi>Nouiciatſhip,</hi> or in the yeare of his Approbation, wrote a letter ſecretly vnto a ſpeciall friend of his, that then liued at <hi>Bruxells,</hi> requeſting him of all Loue, to ſend him an ounce or two of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and a few pipes. The Gentleman willing to pleaſure him, tooke his iourney from <hi>Bruxells</hi> to
<hi>Louain,</hi> which was about twelue Engliſh miles, and brought the
<hi>Tobacco</hi> and pipes with him; and vpon his arriuall to <hi>Louain,</hi> repaired to the <hi>Auguſtine Friers</hi> Cloiſter, to ſpeake with
<hi>Frier Thomas;</hi> but (alas) it would not be granted, becauſe that he was a <hi>Nouice,</hi> and for feare that the partie (being an
<hi>Engliſh-man</hi>) was not a <hi>Catholike;</hi> yet in the end, <hi>Frier Thomas</hi> perceiuing that it was his friend, commended him ſo highly to the
<hi>Prior,</hi> and the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Nouices,</hi> for a good
<hi>Catholike Gentleman,</hi> and with much adoe obtained leaue to ſpeake with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:14140:23"/>The Gentleman being permitted to come into the Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſaluted the <hi>Prior,</hi> and the reſt of the
<hi>Friers,</hi> with ſuch complements, that the <hi>Prior</hi> gaue
<hi>Frier Thomas</hi> leaue, not only to conuerſe with him priuately, but alſo to ſhew him the Cloiſter, Garden, the Church, and the Reliques. The Gentleman giuing the <hi>Prior</hi> many thanks, walked together with <hi>Frier Thomas</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> where <hi>Frier Thomas</hi> and another
<hi>Frier</hi> that was the <hi>Sacriſtan,</hi> (or he that had the charge of the holy things) ſhewed him (among many other <hi>Reliques</hi>) one that was the holieſt of all; which was a little <hi>bit</hi> of <hi>rotten fleſh,</hi> as big as a ſhilling, incloſed in a ſiluer box couered ouer with a criſtall-glaſſe, which holy <hi>Relique</hi> (as they ſaid) had wrought many miracles, and had beene for many yeares in great honour in that Citie.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman being very deſirous to know the whole hiſtory of this holy morſell, for his better edification, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted them to certifie him of the truth. The <hi>Dutch Frier</hi> told him, that there was heretofore a young man dwelling in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleburgh</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> who hauing bin at <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion</hi> on <hi>Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> in the morning with an <hi>Auguſtine Frier,</hi> went home and did eat one morſell of <hi>Bacon,</hi> and drunke too much, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards came to the Church to receiue the bleſſed <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which was no ſooner put into his mouth, but the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low did vomit it vp againe tranſubſtantiated into fleſh, which the holy <hi>Frier</hi> perceiuing, demanded of him what hee had done, who confeſſed his great offence in drinking and eating before the receiuing of the Sacrament, and asked God and our Lady forgiueneſſe, and afterwards became a <hi>Frier</hi> of that Order.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Sacrament</hi> which was ſo miraculouſly tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated into the viſible body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was put into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquary. And afterwards when theſe religious <hi>Friers</hi> were thence expulſed by the Heretikes, this holy <hi>Relique</hi> was miraculouſly preſerued, and conueighed to this Cloiſter at
<hi>Louain,</hi> where it hath beene euer ſince worſhipped with no leſſe <hi>adoration</hi> than the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt. O</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:14140:23"/> 
                  <hi>admirable hoggiſh Relique,</hi> a peece of Bacon worſhipped for the Body of Chriſt! Nay, they haue not beene aſhamed to print a little Treatiſe of the miracles it hath wrought.</p>
               <p>From thence, <hi>Frier Thomas</hi> brought this Gentleman to a Chamber in that Cloiſter, where they did vſe to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſtrangers, and puts a Fagot on the fire, for it was in the winter time; and then began to taſte of the <hi>Tobacco:</hi> but for feare that the other <hi>Friers</hi> ſhould ſmell it, his <hi>Fatherhood</hi> ſtood vpon a ſtoole in the Chimney to blow vp the ſmoke, which came out of his Noſthrils like the ſmoke of a Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.</p>
               <p>Within a while the Gentleman departed, and not long after
<hi>Frier Thomas</hi> was found tardy, taking of a Pipe of ſmoke, and for feare of being put to ſome extraordinary penance, his <hi>Fatherhood</hi> made ſuch an eloquent Oration in commendation of this <hi>Indian</hi> herbe, that he perſwaded the <hi>Prior,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Friers</hi> to take a Pipe of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> which they did, and liked ſo well of it, that they haue vſed it euer ſince: and I make no queſtion, but Father
<hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> will be had in a perpetuall memory in their Bookes for that his good inſtruction.</p>
               <p>There is another famous Engliſh Father of this Order, his name is Father <hi>Baldwin,</hi> a man likewiſe guilty of no great learning. This good Father was ſometimes an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſe to a Goldſmith in
<hi>London,</hi> afterwards in the City of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> he became an
<hi>Auguſtin Mendicant Frier.</hi> I ſaw him there trauerſing the ſtreet with another <hi>Frier,</hi> but I did not ſpeake with him, for I was going in haſte a Ship-boord towards <hi>Holland,</hi> for it was the laſt day of the late <hi>Truce,</hi> that was betweene the King of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prouinces.</hi> I was told that he is now in <hi>England,</hi> and it may well be, for I thinke the <hi>Friers</hi> of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue his roome than his company.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Grenoble,</hi> a City in <hi>France,</hi> there was a
<hi>Frier</hi> of this Order, who in his talke and geſture ſeemed to all men to be a very religious godly man: But (alas) his fortune was bad;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14140:24"/> for as he Sodomitically medled with one of his owne bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, a Frier of the ſelfe ſame Order, he was taken doing the deed: but this horrible fact being forgiuen him vpon his deniall, he was at another time apprehended, impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and puniſhed, for being vnder a Rocke nigh the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid City of <hi>Gronoble</hi> too familiar with a queane.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Auguſtine Frier,</hi> and a Confeſſor, hauing heard the confeſſion of a <hi>Flemming,</hi> inioyned him in his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to goe on Pilgrimage to the Idoll of <hi>Loretto,</hi> to offer his gifts at her Altar, and craue her interceſſion to her Son <hi>Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> and in the meane time this holy Father ſlept with his Wife, and being taken naked in bed by the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the City, they let him goe to his
<hi>Monaſtery,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further trouble or puniſhment, becauſe hee was a graue Father and an eloquent Preacher.</p>
               <p>I haue read that a <hi>Frier</hi> of this Order was impriſoned in <hi>Rome,</hi> in the yeere 1580. for the wilfull murdering of three ſeuerall perſons at ſeuerall times, and yet was neuer exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, for he was a famous Preacher and a great Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Auguſtine Friers</hi> haue a woodden
<hi>Crucifix</hi> in their <hi>Monaſterie</hi> neere <hi>Burgos</hi> in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> that yeelds them no leſſe than ſix or ſeuen thouſand Crownes yeerely. This <hi>Crucifix</hi> (as they themſelues report) was made by one of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and was afterwards found vpon the Seas neere the Coaſt of <hi>Spaine,</hi> together with a Scrowle or Schedule written in good ſtrong Parchment, ſignifying the vertue and holineſſe of this woodden <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And from thence it was (with great ioy and deuotion) brought to this Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, where it is ſet vp in a little Chappell, and had in great honour,
<note place="margin">See the iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of theſe Friers.</note> and hath wrought (as they ſay) many ſtrange Miracles, and is much frequented by the Country people, who offer very largely vnto it.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Crucifix</hi> is as big as any reaſonable man, and moſt artificially carued and painted, it hath a falſe Beard, and a Periwig of a Cheſtnut colour haire, and artificiall nailes ſet on both hands and feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:14140:24"/>They make the ignorant people beleeue that thoſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall haire and nailes of the <hi>Crucifix</hi> doe grow, and that it doth ſweat Water and Bloud euery Friday, which drop downe into a great ſiluer Baſon that is alwaies vnder the feet of the <hi>Crucifix.</hi> Moreouer they ſet Wheat in their Garden, which is a bigger graine than any other ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wheat; of this Wheat they report a wonderfull ſtory: For they ſay, that when <hi>Adam</hi> was driuen out of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> he tooke a whole handfull of the Eares of the Wheat that did grow there, and carried it away with him into the world, and of this kinde of ſeed is there Wheat, which they grind in a little Mill made for that purpoſe; and of the Meale, and the Water and Bloud that the holy <hi>Crucifix</hi> doth ſweat, they make little Cakes as big as a dry Fig, which they ſell for a <hi>quartillo</hi> a peece, which is as much as three halfe pence in Engliſh money. They haue the length of the <hi>Crucifix</hi> in blue ſilke Ribands, with theſe words painted in ſiluer letters, <hi>La Medida del Santo Crucifixo de Burgos:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>The meaſure of the holy Crucifix of Burgos.</hi> Theſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands they ſell for twelue pence a peece; for they ſay that they haue many vertues, and are good for a hundred diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and aboue all the reſt, they are a preſent remedy for the head-ach, and for weomen that are in labour of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth. Nay (if all be true that theſe <hi>Friers</hi> report) there is neuer a <hi>Quack-ſaluer</hi> in Chriſtendome, with all his Oile, Salues and Waters, that doth cure ſo many diſeaſes as theſe Ribands doe. And as for their little Cakes which they call <hi>Pañcillos,</hi> they are precious things for all interiour Diſeaſes, and rare <hi>Antidots</hi> againſt all manner of poiſon: and withall, as long as any one doth carry one of them about his neck, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a clout or a ſiluer caſe, the Deuill can haue no power ouer him.</p>
               <p>The Chappell (where this <hi>Crucifix</hi> is) will ſcarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine twenty perſons, and is made like a Chamber ſeeled ouer, without any windowes at all; and the <hi>Crucifix</hi> is made faſt to a wall ouer the Altar, hauing the head cloſe to the <pb n="40" facs="tcp:14140:25"/> feeling, there hang three ſilke Curtaines before it of three ſeuerall colours,
<hi>viz.</hi> blue, red, and white. They doe vſe (when they doe ſhew this woodden <hi>Chriſt</hi>) great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, for they kneele all downe with great deuotion and ſilence; and then one of the <hi>Friers</hi> very ſoftly drawes the firſt Curtaine, and afterwards ſaith a <hi>Pater</hi> and an
<hi>Aue,</hi> and in like manner the ſecond; but when he comes to the laſt, and that <hi>El Santo Chriſto de Burgos, The holy Chriſt of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos</hi> (for ſo the common people doe call it) begins to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, they lift vp their hands and cry like <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, <hi>Señor Dios mio ayuda me: O my Lord God helpe me.</hi> This cry (which endures about halfe a quarter of an houre) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, then they kiſſe the ground three times, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer their Beads vnto the <hi>Friers,</hi> who haue forked ſticks in their hands, on which they put their Beads, and rub them againſt ſome part of the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> and afterwards put them to the mouth of it, to the end that ſome vertue may be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from the Image vnto theſe Beads. This being done, one of the <hi>Friers</hi> doth caſt ſome holy Water vpon the Beads and the People; and then they caſt the Beads vpon the Altar that euery one may take his owne; in the meane time a holy <hi>Friers</hi> ſtands with a ſiluer Baſon in his hands to receiue the offertories of theſe fools; &amp; in the Porch as they goe forth, there ſits two rewes of
<hi>Friers</hi> with Tables before them, on either hand a Table; one of them ſels thoſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, another thoſe little Cakes, ſome begs Money to ſay Maſſe before the holy <hi>Crucifix,</hi> another to buy Oile, and Wax Candles to burne before it; to conclude, they beg for to light our Lady, and the holy Sacrament, and for twenty ſuch like vſes.</p>
               <p>This Chappell is alwaies locked, ſauing at ſuch time as they ſay Maſſe, and they neuer ſay any Maſſe there, but when ſome foole paies for it; neither doe they ſhew the <hi>Crucifix</hi> but at Maſſetime. But if one brings a good Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they will let him ſee the holy <hi>Crucifix</hi> at any time. I came there vpon a time, in company of one Maſter <hi>Daniel</hi>

But when we went forth, the <hi>Friers</hi> loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſtrangely vpon vs, becauſe wee would giue them no Money. They haue not beene aſhamed to ſet out a booke in Spaniſh, of the Hiſtory and miracles of this

               <head>Of the Carmelite Friers.</head>
               <p>THeſe <hi>Carmelite</hi> or cormorant <hi>Friers,</hi> pretend to haue their firſt inſtitution at Mount <hi>Carmel</hi> in <hi>Syria;</hi> where <hi>Elias</hi> and other Prophets heretofore liued ſolitarily. But (God knowes) there is great difference betweene the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melite Friers,</hi> and
<hi>Elias</hi> and thoſe old Prophets. In this Mount (ſay they) liued a few Hermites ſcattered here and there, who were afterwards gathered together by
<hi>Alme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who built them a Monaſtery in that Mount neere vnto a Fountaine, in which place (they ſay) the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> gaue them their Rule and Order; from whence they borrow (or rather vſurpe) the name or title of <hi>Fratres ordinis beatae Mariae Virginis de monte Carmelo:</hi> that is, <hi>Friers</hi> (forſooth) <hi>of the Order of the bleſſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin Mary of Mount Carmel.</hi> This their firſt apparition into the world was about the yeere
1170. in the time of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third. But becauſe theſe
<hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> had not then any ſetled Order or Inſtitution for Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, Manners, and Ceremonies (which is a thing of no ſmall moment among the Papiſts) it was of moſt men held and reputed as abortiue and illegitimate. And therefore moſt of their owne Writers are of opinion; that about ſome certain yeeres afterwards, in the time of Pope
<hi>Innocentius</hi> the <pb n="42" facs="tcp:14140:26"/> fourth, one <hi>Albertus</hi> then Patriarch of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> gaue vnto theſe men (who then liued in the wilderneſſe) certain Rules or Orders, which he had taken &amp; patched out of the Rule of the <hi>Monks</hi> of the Order of <hi>S. Baſil;</hi> &amp; withall ordained that they ſhould weare a party-coloured habit, that is to ſay, white and red, made in the forme of a Mantle; which they then dreamed, to be like vnto that which <hi>Elias</hi> did vſe to weare. But afterwards Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the third interdicted them to weare that Habit, as being not well befitting their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore a black long habit and a cowle was giuen them, &amp; ouer that a long white robe or cloke, as beſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Virginity, which is without any ſpot or blemiſh: but marke I pray you their hypocriſie. Afterwards they tranſported themſelues out of <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> where they haue euer ſince laboured by all meanes poſſible to magnifie and aduance their owne Order, and the Kingdome of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> And to that end, one <hi>Cyrillus</hi> a <hi>Grecian,</hi> the third generall Prelate of this Order (by the Popes ſetting on and aduice) did affirme to haue receiued a new Goſpell &amp; a new Reuelation from Heauen, written with Gods owne finger, in ſiluer tables in the Greek tongue; wherein (among other blaſphemous and damnable Doctrine) was written, That God the Father had reigned during the time of the Law, and God the Sonne in the time of Grace, but after the comming of the foure Orders of <hi>Mendicant Friers,</hi> (to wit, the <hi>Auguſtins, Carmelites, Dominicans,</hi> and <hi>Franciſcans</hi>) the holy Ghoſt began to reigne, and ſhould reigne vntill the end of the world; and that all ſuch as would beleeue this new Goſpell, ſhould be ſaued. So that if it had not beene for <hi>Valdenſis,</hi> and other good men, that God (in his great mercy) did ſtirre vp in thoſe daies, to reſiſt ſuch a palpable impiety,
<note place="margin">Note well the drift of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</note> there had beene now no mention of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> in the world, for his purpoſe was to aboliſh the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to aduance his deuilliſh doctrine.</p>
               <p>This is the ſecond Order of <hi>Mendicant Friers,</hi> which is in ſuch credit and reputation among women, that they are
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14140:26"/> by their Offerings growne very rich: for they brag (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though moſt falſly) that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is their Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therefore women doe dote vpon them, for the bleſſed Virgins ſake, who is the honour of their Sex: and by this meanes they were, before the Reformation, ſetled in moſt of the chiefeſt Cities of Chriſtendome, and ſtill are in all popiſh Countries. If one doe diſcourſe with any of them, about their antiquity; oh then they will brag, that they are ancienter than any other Order of <hi>Monks</hi> or
<hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi> for (ſay they) our Order hath beene euer ſince the time of <hi>Elias,</hi> and the bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> did renue it, and gather vs together into Cloiſters.</p>
               <p>They haue many Pardons and Indulgences granted vnto them from many Popes: whereof one is, that none of their Order or fraternity ſhall lie in the Popes Kitchin (I would haue ſaid <hi>Purgatory</hi>) no longer than the next Saturday following their death, as appeares by their <hi>Theſes</hi> or Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall queſtions printed at <hi>Paris</hi> in the yeere 1601. which are cited by Maſter <hi>Moulins</hi> in his <hi>Defence of the Catholike Faith;</hi> which <hi>Theſes</hi> I likewiſe read in <hi>Tours.</hi> Wee haue ſome Engliſhmen of this holy Order, and partakers of thoſe diuine Graces and Indulgences, I neuer knew any but Father <hi>Symons,</hi> and Father

               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:14140:27"/>But in the meane time I will leaue them, and returne againe to ſpeake a word or two of their Order. There was heretofore great diſcord among theſe <hi>Carmelite Friers,</hi> about the obſeruation of their Rule, from whence there did ariſe a great ſchiſme among them; ſo that they were diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two Sects, that is to ſay,
<hi>Obſeruantes &amp; non obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes;</hi> and great ſtirre there was betweene them, as you may reade in the laſt Eglog of <hi>Baptiſta Mantuanus,</hi> a <hi>Frier</hi> of this ſelfe ſame Order. But in the end thoſe that called themſelues <hi>Obſeruant Friers</hi> were put to ſilence, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till of late yeeres that a Spaniſh woman, whoſe name was
<hi>Tereza,</hi> vndertooke to reforme this diſordered Order, and hauing gathered together a company of diſcontented lazie <hi>Friers,</hi> and
<hi>Nuns</hi> of this Sect, ſhee gaue them a new Rule, which they affirme to be their ancient Rule, and called the <hi>Friers Carmelius,</hi> and the
<hi>Nuns Carmelineſſes.</hi> Their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in colour doth not much differ from the other <hi>Friers</hi> and <hi>Nuns,</hi> ſauing that it is courſer, and a little more reddiſh, and that they weare neither linnen Shirts, Smocks, Shooes or Stockins, but woodden Clogs or Sandals, and neuer or ſeldome eat Fleſh as yet, but how long this pretended au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity will continue I know not. They profeſſe to lead a holy life; and therefore are in great fauour with the vulgar people, who out of their blind zeale doe dote vpon them, as they doe vpon any new Order of <hi>Friers</hi> or <hi>Nuns:</hi> for they partly know the hypocriſie of the old Order of <hi>Monks</hi> and
<hi>Friers,</hi> and doe hope that theſe and ſuch new Sects will proue better; and therefore they doe contribute to their reliefe, ſo much the more willingly; but before it be long, they ſhall find them to be no better than the reſt, but rather farre worſe, and greater Hypocrites, yet in the interim, they will be ſure with their counterfeit holineſſe, to cheat them of their money, and to furniſh themſelues againſt a rainy day, as the old Prouerbe is.</p>
               <p>It is not many yeares agoe, that this new Sect of
<hi>Carmelin</hi> and <hi>Carmelineſſe</hi> began, and now they haue Cloiſters, in all <pb n="45" facs="tcp:14140:27"/> the chiefeſt Townes and Cities of
<hi>Spaine, Italy, France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and <hi>Netherland,</hi> that are vnder the Catholike Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Neuertheleſſe, they could not haue their
<hi>Spaniſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſſe</hi> ſanctified, though they made great ſute to the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> But I thinke it was becauſe they had not
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Indicum,</hi> to beſtow vpon his Holineſſe; howbeit, ſhee was <hi>Beatified</hi> many yeares ago, which is the next ſtep to be
<hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi> And when lame <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the Patron of the
<hi>Ieſuites,</hi> was Canonized by <hi>Pope Paul</hi> the fifth, theſe
<hi>Carmelins</hi> were almoſt mad, for anger and griefe, that their
<hi>Patroneſſe</hi> was not placed among the Saints, as well as hee; And therefore they printed a booke of her life, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit miracles, ſtufft with ſuch deteſtable lyes, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, that it would grieue any good Chriſtian to reade it. And then the <hi>Popes</hi> ſweet Worſhip, for quietneſſe ſake, and at the Catholike King of <hi>Spains</hi> intreaty, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified this ſhe creature, to the no ſmall ioy, comfort and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, of all theſe <hi>Carmelins</hi> and <hi>Carmelineſſes.</hi> Euer ſince which time, the common people (that are addicted to this Order) doe ſo dote vpon this new ſanctified Creature, and her ſpirituall babes, that they thinke nothing that they haue too good for theſe holy <hi>Carmelin Friers,</hi> and <hi>Carmelineſſe Nunnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you may ſee how his Catholicke Maieſtie of
<hi>Spaine</hi> is conſtrained to play the broker betweene theſe Spaniſh ſhauellings and the <hi>Pope,</hi> to haue his Spaniſh
<hi>Machiauillians</hi> and their Patrons Canonized Saints, when, God wot, it is to be feared, that they are all damn'd in hell. For if you wil well obſerue, the <hi>Popes</hi> haue for theſe forty years Sanctified none but
<hi>Spanyards,</hi> or at leaſt the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> ſubiects; as for example, <hi>S. Carolus Boromëus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> and ſometimes a <hi>Capuchin Frier, Ignatius de Loyola, S. Tereza,</hi> and ſome three or foure more, haue beene placed into the Catalogue of Saints, to the great honour of <hi>Spaine</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) and to his Catholike Maieſties no ſmall charges, and the <hi>Popes</hi> great profit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:14140:28"/>But truly, I wonder that his Holineſſe doth not Sanctifie Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian-gun-powder Traytors, yea <hi>Francis Rauiliac,</hi> that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> ſeeing they were all his ſworne babes, and the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Miniſters and Agents.</p>

<hi>Pluto</hi> and the reſt of the Deuills could ſcarce rule them. The

               <p>Being in my lodging in the Citie of <hi>Valencia</hi> in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> vpon Shroue-ſunday in the after-noone; there came in two
<hi>Dominican Friers,</hi> and a man that carried a great paper-book and an inkhorne in his band. The <hi>Friers</hi> demanded of the good-wife, if ſhee would haue her name written in their booke? The woman told them, that her husband had beene taken twice priſoner by the <hi>Moores,</hi> and that ſhe had ſpent almoſt all that ſhe had to pay his ranſomes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired them to excuſe her for that time: whereupon the <hi>Friers</hi> departed away in a great rage. I maruelling to ſee them depart ſo diſcontented, asked her the reaſon: ſhe told me that theſe
<hi>Friers</hi> had in their Cloiſter, a viall full of the milke of the bleſſed Virgin, and that the moſt part of all the women of that Citie and Countrey neare adioyning did vſe to write their names in their booke, and in the Lent-time <pb n="51" facs="tcp:14140:30"/> to come to them for a little of the milke. And why (ſaid I) would you not let them write your name in their booke? ſhe anſwered me, becauſe ſhee was not able to giue them money; for (ſaid ſhe) the pooreſt woman doth giue them two crownes, and yet they haue not aboue a little thimble-full of milke. Then I began to queſtion with her; and demanded of her, how long had theſe <hi>Friers</hi> this milke? and how much might it be in quantitie, that could ſerue ſo many women? what was it good for? and withall I told her, that I did much wonder, that it conſumed not, and how they could get enough to ſerue ſo many perſons: for the Citie is very great, and in my conſcience, ſixteene of the beſt kine in
<hi>Cheſhire</hi> cannot giue at one milking, ſo much milke, as would ſuffice to giue euery woman in that Citie, and the Countrey thereunto adioyning, a thimble-full of milke: Then ſhe began to tell me, how that theſe <hi>Friers</hi> had a little viall, full of the milke of the bleſſed Virgin, for many yeares ago; and in the time of Lent, they vſed to powre one drop of it, into a great quantitie of white goats-milke, the which it ſanctified being ſtirred together; and yet the milke in the viall doth not waſte or diminiſh. The <hi>Poet,</hi> perhaps, meant this milke, when he ſaid:<note place="margin">

<hi>Rome</hi>) procured for him a new ſute of apparell, cloake, and all things elſe, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-like, and yet payed neuer a peny for them, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to cleare the ſcore with <hi>Maſſes, De Profundis,</hi> and
<hi>Diriges.</hi> I wonder whether our Salemen in <hi>Burchen</hi> Lane, or Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apoſtle will take a <hi>Trentall</hi> or two of
<hi>Maſſes</hi> of him for a new ſute. But I would aduiſe him not to goe on the ſcore with them, if hee giues them no better payment than
<hi>Maſſes,</hi> leſt hee be clapt with a Maſe on the breſt, with the old word <hi>I arreſt you ſir,</hi> when he ſhall not bee weary, vnleſſe it be of the Sergeants company. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, I doubt not but that there are ſome good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Taylors about <hi>London,</hi> that would not ſticke to truſt a holy <hi>Frier</hi> with a Secular ſure, rather than he ſhould want. And withall, if our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholike Ladies and Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will loue him as well as the <hi>Spaniſh Señoras</hi> did, then his Father-hood need not to goe vpon truſt. And I hope that his Reuerence hath crammed his purſe with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolls before his departure from thence.</p>

               <head>Of the Franciſcan Friers, otherwiſe called the Gray Friers.</head>
               <p>THis <hi>Idoll</hi> whom they call Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> profeſſed at the firſt the Rule of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and wore that Habit <pb n="58" facs="tcp:14140:34"/> that the <hi>Auguſtin Mendicant Fries</hi> now vſe: But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being ſomewhat ſcrupulous (remembring how our Sauiour had commanded his Diſciples (when he ſent them forth to preach the Goſpell) <hi>not to weare two coats, or to carry any bag or wallet with them</hi>) he wore a long gray coat downe to his heeles, with a Cowle or a Hood, &amp; a Cord or Rope about his loines in ſteed of a girdle, and went bare foot, and liued in the Wilderneſſe, on the top of the
<hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penine</hi> hills, at a place which they now call <hi>Auerna,</hi> where he receiued (if you will beleeue them) the markes of the wounds that our Sauiour had in his hands, ſide, and feet. Afterwards he gathered a company of lazy <hi>Friers</hi> together, and built them a Couent at <hi>Aſylo,</hi> a Towne in <hi>Vmbria,</hi> a Region of <hi>Italy,</hi> and called his
<hi>Friers, Fratres Manores,</hi> or <hi>Minorite Friers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, approued of his Order, and gaue them many Priuileges, Pardons, Indulgences, and Graces. And afterwards Saint <hi>Francis</hi> died, and within two yeeres after, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth canonized him a Saint, which was in the yeere 1129.</p>
               <p>There was neuer any Order of Friers, that increaſed like this Order; for there is neuer a City or Towne of any worth, vnder the Catholique Dominion, but that theſe <hi>Friers</hi> haue a Couent; and before the Reformation, they had Cloiſters in all the Countries of Chriſtendome. And here in <hi>England</hi> they had many famous Couents, whereof
<hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>London</hi> was the chiefeſt.</p>
               <p>What this man, whom they call Saint <hi>Francis</hi> was, I know not, it may be he was a good zealous man, and yet ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious according to the time. But this I am aſſured of, his <hi>Friers</hi> are as great Blaſphemers, Hypocrites, and Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, as any in the world whatſoeuer. And whereas it is reported of him, that he firſt profeſſed the Rule of Saint
<hi>Auguſtine;</hi> but becauſe he was ſcrupulous, and would not weare two Coats, or carry a Wallet, he erected another Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: I conclude, it was a very poore excuſe. But admit it to be true, then his <hi>Friers</hi> are not of the ſame opinion, and they <pb n="59" facs="tcp:14140:34"/> obſerue not his Rule, for they carry Wallets ouer their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from doore to doore daily through all Cities, Townes, and Countries whereſoeuer they inhabit, as hereafter ſhall be proued. And as for the markes of our Sauiours wounds, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> his <hi>Friers</hi> affirme and brag that he had in his body, I thinke it is but a loud lie. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould rather haue them than Saint
<hi>Francis;</hi> for the Apoſtle ſaith thus of himſelfe, <hi>Ego ſtigmata Domini noſtri Ieſu Chriſti in corpore meo porto.</hi> And yet it is apparant that the Apoſtle had them not, but ſpoke that in another ſenſe. And yet the <hi>Friers</hi> of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> his Order, vſurpe that ſentence, and attribute it only to their Patron. For in their Churches whereſoeuer any Picture or Image of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> is, you ſhall finde thoſe words vnder written, <hi>Ego ſtigmata Domini noſtri, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſhall I tell you what a good Iouiall <hi>Auguſtine Frier</hi> told me of this Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> as I trauelled with him and another Frier of his Order, vpon a time betweene <hi>Bayon</hi> and
<hi>Bourdeaux</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> among other queſtions to paſſe away the tediouſneſſe of the way; I demanded of him, if he did beleeue that Saint <hi>Francis</hi> had thoſe markes in his body. He anſwered me, That he had certaine markes in his body, which he receiued not from
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> but from Saint <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke,</hi> for if you will (ſaid he) heare me patiently, and not laugh, I will reſolue you in that matter. I promiſed I would.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Dominick</hi> and Saint <hi>Francis</hi> (ſaid he) were both great friends, and kept company for a long time. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> was a Scholler and a great Preacher, and Saint <hi>Francis</hi> a dolt, a great Gurmund and a Glutton, as all his Friers are. It fortuned vpon a time, as they were both together, that a good <hi>Lady</hi> or <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> (that was much deuoted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Friers, as many women are) ſent them a fore-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Veale vpon a Saturday night for a preſent, requeſting the two Saints to pray for her. The next day Saint <hi>Dominick</hi> was to goe to a certaine pariſh Church a mile or two from home to preach, and Saint
<hi>Francis</hi> and Frier <hi>Gyles</hi> were to ſtay at home to play the Cookes (for Saint <hi>Francis</hi> and his Friers, were euer fitter for the Kitchin than for the Pulpit.) <pb n="60" facs="tcp:14140:35"/> But before ſuch time that
<hi>Dominick</hi> and his Mate departed, Frier <hi>Gyles,</hi> according to his directions, laid the ſhoulder of that Veale to the fire to roaſt, reſeruing the breaſt for their Supper. And ſo Saint <hi>Dominick</hi> and his Frier repaired to the Church to preach, where hee made a long Sermon, of purpoſe that his fellow, Frier <hi>Diego,</hi> ſhould haue time enough to gather the beneuolence of the people for Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> as the cuſtome is in moſt Catholique Countries, to collect for the Preacher, if he be a ſtranger.</p>
               <p>In the meane time Saint <hi>Francis</hi> and Frier
<hi>Gyles</hi> (being very hungry) beganne to feed vpon the meat as it was vpon the ſpit, ſo that bit after bit, they eat it all vp to the very bare bones. Within a while after, <hi>Dominick</hi> and his brother <hi>Diego</hi> came home, hauing their ſtomacks in <hi>folio,</hi> and ſeeing the meat all eaten, Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> being ouercome with anger, ſnatch't the broach, and in a ſuſtian fume ran at Saint <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis:</hi> But the good man, hauing nothing to defend himſelfe, was thruſt with the ſpit into the ſide, and thorow both the hands, and in the end, cloſing with
<hi>Dominick,</hi> was likewiſe thruſt downeward thorow both his feet, and then the holy man fell downe. The other two Friers were not idle all this while, for they cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t each other, as if they had beene a couple of Car-men; but Frier <hi>Gyles</hi> (like a tall Souldier) bang'd poore hunger-ſtaru'd <hi>Diego,</hi> as if he had beene a ſtock-fiſh, till he was almoſt blind.</p>
               <p>In the end, <hi>Dominick</hi> being better pacified, his choller be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouerpaſt, and fearing that if this combat ſhould be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, that it would tend to their diſgrace, and a great ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to their profeſſion, intreated Saint <hi>Francis</hi> to forgiue him, and to be friends with him; promiſing very faithfully, that he would in recompence thereof, the next Sunday, and euer afterwards, preach and auouch in his Sermons, <hi>That our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt had appeared vnto Saint</hi> Francis, <hi>and had in token of his extraordinary loue to him, imprinted in his body the markes or fiue wounds that the Nailes and the Speare had made in his body vpon the Croſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon Saint <hi>Francis</hi> was contented, and
<hi>Dominick,</hi> and himſelfe, together with Frier <hi>Gyles</hi> and
<hi>Diego,</hi> were <pb n="61" facs="tcp:14140:35"/> reconciled friends, and
<hi>Dominick</hi> powred Balſam into the wounds, and the good Saint went neuer abroad vntill they were all healed. Frier <hi>Giles</hi> with all ſpeed made readie the breſt of veale for Saint <hi>Dominick</hi> and Frier
<hi>Diego;</hi> who the next Sunday and euer afterwards preached of the marks that our Sauiour had giuen vnto Saint <hi>Francis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But afterwards the <hi>Dominican</hi> Friers, perceiuing that all men did beleeue all this to be true, that <hi>Dominick</hi> had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> and that the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friers did fare the better by reaſon of thoſe ſuppoſed marks, which their
<hi>Seraphicall</hi> Patron Saint <hi>Francis</hi> was thought to haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and were more honoured of the common people, and reputed to be holier men than they; enuying and repining at their proſperity, they reuealed the whole knaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, though too late. And this is the reaſon that the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> and <hi>Dominican</hi> Friers doe hate one another. Hitherunto are the words of the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Friers. But ſince that time I haue read this ſelfe-ſame Hiſtory in a little
<hi>French</hi> Pamphlet.</p>
               <p>Now concerning <hi>S. Francis</hi> himſelfe and his miracles, if you will beleeue his <hi>Friers,</hi> Chriſt and his Apoſtles neuer wrought halfe ſo many nor ſuch ſtrange miracles as he did. They write of him ſuch abominable lyes, &amp; horrible impious blaſphemies; yea ſuch ridiculous and abſurd ribaldries, that I am aſhamed to rehearſe them, left I ſhould offend your chaſte Eares; and therefore I will produce you but one or two, and ſo paſſe ouer the reſt with ſilence.</p>
               <p>There was (ſay they) a woman that did long to eat of her owne childes fleſh, and being not able to forbeare any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and hauing fit opportunitie (her husband being from home) ſhee killed her owne naturall childe, being a boy of two yeares old, and did roaſt a quarter of him, and afterwards eat it. Within a while her husband came home, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing what had happened, drew forth his ſword, and would haue killed her. Whereupon the woman being well deuoted to Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> called vnto him for helpe; who preſently came, and ſtood betweene her and her husband, and tooke the other three quarters of the childe, that were not eaten, and reſtored him againe aliue, all ſafe, ſound, and compleat, as he <pb n="62" facs="tcp:14140:36"/> was before, into his fathers hands, which childe became af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a
<hi>Frier</hi> of good Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Order. Yea, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> are farre beyond thoſe of Chriſt or his Apoſtles: for <hi>Francis</hi> tamed wilde beaſts; he preached vnto a Wolfe, and conuerted him from his crueltie, calling him by the name of his brother Wolfe, and made the towne of <hi>Engubia</hi> and him friends, who of long time before had beene at contention;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide lib. Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. S. Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci.</hi>
                  </note> and for the aſſuring of the peace, he made his brother Wolfe to giue him his faith, in the market-place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Magiſtrates; and afterwards the Wolfe went vp and downe the Citie, and tooke his meat from doore to doore. I wonder <hi>S. Francis</hi> did not make his brother Wolfe a Gray <hi>Frier.</hi> But I ſuppoſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholikes will not beleeue this to be true, that the <hi>Franciſcan Friers</hi> would euer write ſuch lyes of their holy Patron. And yet I would intreat them to looke into the holy booke of the Conformities of <hi>S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> and there they ſhall finde all this, and much more: as how the birds of the aire would come flying, and the beaſts floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king about him, to heare him preach, and how the Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales, and other birds, would come and helpe him to ſay Maſſe, and ſing his Office, and would anſwer him verſe for verſe. All this is not inuented by mee, but written in that booke, and defended by them to this day. And therefore, I would wiſh thoſe that vnderſtand not the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, to buy a little booke intituled <hi>The Alcaron of the bare-foot Friers;</hi> which containes a heape of blaſphemies and lyes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the booke of the Conformities of Saint
<hi>Francis,</hi> which Pamphlet was printed at <hi>London</hi> by <hi>William White,</hi> 1603.</p>
               <p>They are not aſhamed to report that <hi>S. Francis</hi> was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſuch manner into Chriſt, that the one could not be knowne from the other, but by their different habite, as <hi>Frier Horacio Turcelin</hi> affirmes, in theſe enſuing verſes:

               <p>This Schiſme began, when one <hi>Creſcentius de Eſeyo</hi> was <hi>Generall</hi> of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> about the yeare of our Lord 1205. At which time ſome of theſe Friers called themſelues,

Neuertheleſſe, within a while after, they began to breed againe in the Prouince of <hi>Narbon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> about the yeare of our Lord
1317. and afterwards in other Prouinces. And <pb n="67" facs="tcp:14140:38"/> about the yeare 1352. they made ſuit vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> by the interceſſion of many great Perſonages, that whereas their Rule or Order, had bin gloſſed and commented vpon by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers <hi>Popes,</hi> quite contrary to the will and meaning of their Patron, Saint <hi>Francis;</hi> and was ſo kept and obſerued of all the whole body of their Sect; that his Holineſſe would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them ſome place, where they might liue ſtrictly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the literall meaning of their Rule, without any gloſſe at all. Whereupon, the
<hi>Pope</hi> appointed them foure Cloiſters, where they ſhould liue; but prohibiting them, not to exceed the number of twelue, in one Cloiſter. But within a while <hi>Pope Innocence</hi> the ſixt, did reuoke this decree or priuiledge. Yet for all that, the Inſtitution of theſe <hi>Obſeruant</hi> Friers, was not altogether extinguiſhed, or aboliſhed; for ſome few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques or dregges thereof did ſtill remaine; albeit they were cruelly perſecuted, of the <hi>Conuentuall</hi> Friers, and of their <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, Prouincialls,</hi> and <hi>Guardians;</hi> and withall, purſued and cenſured by many Prouinciall Councells. In the end, they ſollicited and beſought the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> in the yeare 1414. to protect and defend their Order or Family, and to grant them leaue, to obſerue and exerciſe the ſtrict Rule of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> and to permit them to haue a <hi>Generall, Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialls, Guardians</hi> and <hi>

King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth brought them into <hi>England,</hi> and King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth augmented their number, in whoſe time they had ſix famous Cloiſters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whereof <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>London</hi> was one. <hi>Baleus &amp; Polydor lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>This Schiſme betweene the <hi>Minorite</hi> Friers was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied (as I haue read) by one <hi>Guido,</hi> a Frier of their Order, long before that it began. Their Habit is of a more darker gray than the
<hi>Conuentuall</hi> Friers.</p>
               <p>But now there are many other Sects of Friers that chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Saint <hi>Francis</hi> for their Patron, whereof the <hi>Capuchins, Recollects, Penitentiarians,</hi> and the French <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> whom they report Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> to haue ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14140:40"/> are the chiefeſt. Euery one of all which doth challenge to be of the inſtitution of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> and to liue according to his Rule and Diſcipline. And doe exclaime one againſt another moſt ſhamefully, in ſo much that there is no more loue and amity betweene them, than betweene <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Turkes,</hi> no not ſo much; for
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre and trafficke, yea ſometimes eat and drinke together. But Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> his holy ghoſtly children, will not ſo much as ſpeake a good word one of the other.</p>
               <p>The other Sect of Friers, that claimed <hi>Francis</hi> for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron and Inſtituter, who were called <hi>Amadeani, Minimi, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formati, fratres de Euangelio, Chiacini, Paulini, Boſiani, Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes, fratres de portiuncula, &amp;c.</hi> are now for the moſt part either vnited to the <hi>Obſeruants, Recollects, Penitentiarians,</hi> or
<hi>Capuchins,</hi> or elſe quite diſſolued and aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Friers that <hi>Francis</hi> did inſtitute, as I finde in their owne Bookes, were inioyned to labour for their liuing, as appeareth by his laſt Will and Teſtament; but now a daies theſe lazy Lubbars ſcorne to worke, and liue by begging: yea, it is no leſſe than Hereſie, to ſay that Friers muſt worke.</p>
               <p>Their Patron (among other things) commanded them to weare but one Frocke or Coat, and not to carry either Bag or Wallet: and yet theſe holy men neuer goe abroad without a great Wallet ouer their ſhoulders, as big as a Sack; I ſpeake not of their ſleeues, which are as wide as they may well carry a dozen of white bread in either of them. And beſides the
<hi>Capuchins, Recollects,</hi> and <hi>Penitentiarians,</hi> doe weare ſhort Clokes ouer their Frocks. And withall, euery one of them all hath two Coats or Frocks to ſhift himſelfe withall when he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Friers that are called <hi>Conuentuales,</hi> or <hi>non obſeruantes,</hi> doe weare a long whitiſh gray Coat or Frocke, cloſe before, downe to their heeles, with a Hood or a Cowle to couer their heads, the lower part reaching downe round about their ſhoulders and breſts; and ouer this Habit they weare a Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle made of a Cord with many knots tied on it, which they call Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Girdle, which is a holy thing, as they ſay. Vnderneath this Habit, they weare Doublets, Breeches,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14140:40"/> Shirts, gray Stockins, and Shooes. They haue Couents in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and in no other Countrie, and Lands and reuenues to maintaine themſelues, and doe very ſeldome beg publikely, but priuately, and therefore haue all things that they want brought vnto them.</p>
               <p>The obſeruant <hi>Franciſcans</hi> doe weare the ſelfe ſame kinde of Habit, ſauing that it is a little a more darke gray; and profeſſe (as I told you before) to leade a more auſtere life than the
<hi>Conuentuals,</hi> for they haue no Lands or Reuenues, other than the Wallet or Scrip, neither will they touch any money; but they can command money at their pleaſure, as I haue formerly told you. They flouriſh in <hi>Italy, Spaine, France, Netherland,</hi> and many other Prouinces.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Penitentiarian Franciſcan</hi> Friers, doe affirme that Saint <hi>Francis</hi> did inſtitute three Orders, that is to ſay, The
<hi>Obſeruant Franciſcans,</hi> themſelues, and an Order of
<hi>Nuns,</hi> which are called <hi>Clariſſae,</hi> or
<hi>Clariſtae;</hi> who take their names of one <hi>Clara,</hi> that was a very ſuperſtitious woman, and <hi>Francis</hi> his Mate. Theſe
<hi>Penitentiarian</hi> Friers, haue but very few Couents, and thoſe in
<hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to doe penance for themſelues, and for others, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for their Benefactors, and ſuch as are married folkes. They weare no linnen, as they ſay; neither doublet, breeches, or hoſe, but only a little paire of linnen drawers, to ſaue their priuy members from their courſe Habit; in ſtead of Shooes they weare woodden clogs vnder their feet, bound ouer with leather ſtraps. Their Habit is made of a very courſe cloth, and cloſe before, reaching downe to their heeles, with a Cowle cloſe to their head made of the ſame; and a gray Rope, made of haire, full of knots (in ſtead of a girdle about their loines.) They neuer ride when they trauell, but goe a foot. Withall, they haue a great woodden paire of Beads, with a woodden Croſſe at the end, tyed to their Girdle before them.</p>
               <p>There is another Order of <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friers in
<hi>France,</hi> which they call the third Order of Saint <hi>Francis;</hi> which (as they ſay) was erected by Saint <hi>Lewis,</hi> King of
<hi>France,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his returne from the warres of the holy Land. Theſe Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <pb n="72" facs="tcp:14140:41"/> haue no lands, but may poſſeſſe money: and of all the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friers, theſe are the moſt diſſolute; for they are common Whoremongers, Gameſters, and Drunkards. They haue no Couents, but onely in <hi>France,</hi> where they liued for a long time in no great reputation; but now of late, many of them are reformed (forſooth) and are turned either <hi>Obſeruant Franciſcans,</hi> or <hi>Recollects.</hi> In their Habit they doe differ little or nothing from the
<hi>Obſeruants.</hi> Their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Cloiſters are (like the
<hi>Conuentuals,</hi> and the <hi>Obſeruant Franciſcans</hi>) very faire and ſpacious, built like <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Recollect Friers.</note>The <hi>Recollect Franciſcans</hi> are a kinde of reformed <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,</hi> and doe differ little or nothing at all in Habit from the <hi>Penitentiarians;</hi> but in their Rule, Diſcipline, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, they are quite contrary the one to the other. This Sect began of late yeeres, and yet they haue at this inſtant Couents in all the chiefeſt Townes and Cities of <hi>Italy, Spaine, France,</hi> and <hi>Netherland.</hi> There is a Couent of Engliſh Friers of this Order at <hi>Doway,</hi> in the Low Countries, who are maintained by the beneuolence of our Engliſh Catholikes in <hi>England.</hi> It is not aboue fiue or ſix yeeres ſince it was built, and yet they begin to increaſe apace, for they haue their Prouinciall and Collectors here in <hi>England,</hi> as well as the other Friers, Prieſts, and Ieſuites. Theſe
<hi>Recollects</hi> muſt handle no money, but they may poſſeſſe it, and receiue and diſpurſe it, by their Collectors, Receiuers, and Diſpencers: yet our Engliſh Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may handle and poſſeſſe money, when they are in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for they haue a diſpenſation from the Popes holineſſe, to handle and poſſeſſe both gold and ſiluer.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Capuchin Friers.</note>The moſt holy and renowned Sect of all the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friers, are the
<hi>Capuchins;</hi> who weare the like Habit as the <hi>Recollect</hi> and
<hi>Penitentiarians</hi> doe, ſauing that in ſtead of Shooes, they patch three or foure leather ſoles vnder their feet, tyed ouer with leather ſtraps; and on their backs, vpon their Habit, they weare a peece of another old Habit ſewed to their Frock, in token of humility; becauſe (forſooth) they will not weare a new Habit, without that patch, forfeare that the world ſhould imagine them to be proud. And yet, who is <pb n="73" facs="tcp:14140:41"/> prouder than theſe Hypocrites in heart, though not in habit. Moreouer, in their holy greaſie ſtinking Cowle, they differ from all the other
<hi>Franciſcan</hi> Babes; for theſe men weare a long Cowle or Hood, ſewed to the necke, or collar of their Frocke, very ſmall at the end or top: I neuer beheld a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins</hi> Cowle, but I muſt needs thinke of a crying Bird, which ſome call a <hi>Lapwing,</hi> that breeds and liues vpon Heaths and Moores; for this Fowle hath a tuft of Feathers vpon the head ſtanding vpright, and ſo is the <hi>Capuchins</hi> Cowle. And truly I may wel compare theſe <hi>Capuchins</hi> to <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wings,</hi> not only for their heads, but alſo, becauſe the one is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubtil and crafty for to protect &amp; defend their young ones, and the others for the propagation of their Order or Sect.</p>
               <p>This Sect beganne neere about the ſame time, that the
<hi>Ieſuits</hi> did ſtart vp, which was about the yeere of our Lord 1540. Their Author or Inſtitutor was one <hi>Godefridus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> of
<hi>Buſcano</hi> in the Prouince of <hi>Piemont</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> vnder the Dominion of the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> who was the firſt
<hi>Generall</hi> of their Order.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Godefridus,</hi> albeit that in his youth, he had liued in the thickeſt darkneſſe of ſuperſtition, yet afterwards (being inſpired with diuine grace) forſooke Popery, and embraced the truth of the Goſpell: for comming vpon a time in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Cardinall <hi>Carrafa</hi> (who was ſent as a Legat from the Pope to the French King) he forſooke him and his Religion at <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and went from thence to
<hi>Geneua,</hi> where (being inſtructed and confirmed in the Chriſtian Religion) he remained for a certaine time; and afterwards comming backe to
<hi>Buſcano,</hi> his owne Country, as he was trauelling thence towards
<hi>Angeronia</hi> (where he was choſen to be their Miniſter) in his iourney at a place called <hi>Borgeſio,</hi> he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and thence brought to <hi>Turino</hi> (where the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> keepes his Court) where, after ſuch time that he had conſtantly profeſſed, and defended the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, he was burned aliue to death before the Court gate, in the yeere of our Lord 1557.<note place="margin">

               <p>Theſe <hi>Capuchins,</hi> nor the <hi>Recollects,</hi> or
<hi>Penitentiarians,</hi> neuer ſing high Maſſe, but all priuate Maſſes; neither doe <pb n="74" facs="tcp:14140:42"/> they ſing, but onely recite their Canonicall houres, or vſe any Organs or Hymnes, or any Copes or Surplices, as the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruant,</hi> and <hi>non Obſeruant Franciſcans,</hi> and other <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> doe; but they reade their Office, or canonicall houres, leiſurely and diſtinctly: yea, they reade ſo leiſurely, as one may write euery word they ſpeake; and to ſay the truth, they cry or whine when they reade, much like poore French Beggers, when they begge almes at mens doores. Moreouer, the Quire, or the place where they ſit, to recite their Office or <hi>Canonicall</hi> houres, is behind the high Altar, in the vpper end of the Church, with a partition wall betweene; in which wall, right ouer the midſt of the Altar, there is a great hole, or a window of Cryſtall Glaſſe; thorow the which, they may ſee the eleuation of their breaden god, I meane their Sacrament, when it is eleuated at time of Maſſe. Their Churches are not very ſpacious, but very neat, and moſt commonly they haue therein but one Chapell or two at the moſt, wherein is but one Altar ſet vp to ſay Maſſe.</p>
               <p>Here I would haue you to vnderſtand, that all theſe Sects of
<hi>Friers</hi> formerly mentioned, or to be mentioned in this Treatiſe, haue ſeuerall Ceremonies; or to ſay more plainly, apiſh tricks, in ſinging or ſaying of the Maſſe, and other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Seruice; as for example, the
<hi>Capuchin</hi> Frier that ſerues at the Maſſe, that is to ſay, he that plaies the Clarke (who moſt commonly is a Lay-brother, and no Maſſe-Prieſt) doth alwaies from the time of the Sacrament, vntill the
<hi>Offerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> that is to ſay, vntill the Prieſt doth offer it as a
<hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium placabile pro vniuis &amp; defunctis,</hi> an acceptable Sacrifice for the liuing, and for the dead, (to wit in Purgatory) yea if they be well payed for Cow and Calfe: the Frier (I ſay) that ſerues at Maſſe vpon his knees, muſt ſtretch out both his armes right forth croſſe wiſe, ſo that his body may be like a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> and for his paines he ſhall obtaine a great reward in Heauen, and doth queſtionleſſe merit (ſay they) either the deliuery of a ſoule out of Purgatory, or elſe at leaſtwiſe ſome relexation of the paines of the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carolus Boromeus,</hi> Arch-biſhop and Cardinall of
<hi>Milan,</hi> was once a <hi>Capuchin</hi> Frier, and afterwards (by diſpenſation <pb n="75" facs="tcp:14140:42"/> from the Pope) was promoted vnto all theſe honours. And whithin a while after his death, ſanctified by Pope
<hi>Paul</hi> the fift. He was the firſt man that this Pope cauſed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in the Catalogue of Saints. This Canonization brought into the Popes Exchequer more than twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, as I haue heard the
<hi>Milaneſſes</hi> themſelues cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly report. I ſaw vpon the ground where his body had beene buried,
<note place="margin">For it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the graue againe, vpon the Popes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to make Reliques of it.</note> (which was within the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Milan,</hi> before the high Altar) more than two buſhels of gold and ſiluer in a great heape, incloſed with in a great high iron grate, where no body could come at it, which was the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſimple ignorant people; all which, and much more, was for his Holineſſe. To be briefe, this was the firſt (as I thinke) of all the <hi>Capuchins</hi> that haue beene, as yet ſanctified. But Pope <hi>Paul</hi> (perceiuing the profit to be ſo great) did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards canonize halfe a ſquadron more, whereof limping <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the Author or Inſtituter of the Sect of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> was one.</p>
               <p>Is it not an abſurd and a baſe thing, for Dukes, Princes, Noble men, Gentlemen, and other wealthy men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any want or compulſion, to become begging Friers? Would you not thinke ſuch men mad? and thoſe that giue them almes, no better than fools? I know there are ſome that will not beleeue this to be true: and yet it is moſt certaine, for I will name you two or three that I knew. The firſt is Duke <hi>Ioyeux,</hi> a French man, a great enemy to the Profeſſors of the Goſpell; and one, that for many yeeres had borne armes againſt King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of
<hi>France,</hi> our gracious Queenes Father, in the ciuill warres of
<hi>France;</hi> who, when the warres was ended, became a <hi>Capuchin</hi> Frier, being then aboue fifty yeeres old, leauing all his eſtate to his only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and heire. I haue ſeene him in his Habit with a Wallet ouer his ſhoulder, in company of another <hi>Capuchin,</hi> begge from doore to doore in his owne Country, in that Prouince wherein he was borne. But what is it that
<hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> cannot bewitch men to doe? They made him change his Chriſten name, and call himſelfe Frier <hi>Angell,</hi> afterwards he was made a Maſſe-Prieſt. In the end, this Father
<hi>Angell,</hi> 
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:14140:43"/> and one Father <hi>Arch-Angell,</hi> otherwiſe Father <hi>William Barlow,</hi> an Engliſh <hi>Capuchin</hi> Frier, who is now liuing in <hi>Paris,</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> to the Chapter Generall of the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins,</hi> about ſome nineteene yeeres agoe; and in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home, this Duke-like <hi>Capuchin</hi> fell ſicke of a burning Feuer, and died about <hi>Sauoy.</hi> Alas, good Frier, he was not vſed to goe ſuch a voiage on foot, as <hi>Roan</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi> is from <hi>Rome,</hi> being aboue a thouſand Engliſh miles.</p>
               <p>The other is the Duke of <hi>Aſcots</hi> brother, a very proper young noble man, who together with another noble mans ſonne of
<hi>Spaine</hi> (whoſe name I forget) by the perſwaſions of the
<hi>Capuchin</hi> Friers, priuately departed from the Arch-Dukes Court at
<hi>Bruxels,</hi> and without the conſent or priuity of their friends, became
<hi>Capuchins.</hi> I could relate here many ſuch examples, if it were not for breuity ſake.</p>
               <p>There are many Engliſh men of this Order, both in
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Netherland,</hi> and moſt of them Gentlemens ſonnes of good reckoning, and ſome of them now lurking about the Court and City, not in their fooliſh <hi>Capuchin</hi> Habit, but like Gallants, endeuouring to ſeduce his Maieſties ſubiects from their duty to God, and their allegeance to their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne. And one aboue all the reſt is too much frequent in the Court, but I would wiſh him to walke more narrowly, or elſe depart quickly.</p>
               <p>There is (almoſt) neuer a Towne or City in thoſe popiſh Countries, but the <hi>Obſeruants, Recollects,</hi> and <hi>Capuchin</hi> Friers haue Couents; and in ſome great Cities the <hi>Capuchins</hi> haue two or three, as in <hi>Rome, Milan, Paris,</hi> and other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And yet they haue neither Lands or Reuenues, but what they get by begging. Neuertheleſſe, they fare more like Princes, than ſuch men as they profeſſe themſelues to be: for albeit they touch no money, yet haue they their Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Receiuers, and Diſpencers, to receiue and diſpurſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for them; and to buy any thing that they want. For if any man or woman will beſtow any money vpon them, they will ſend for their Receiuer to take it, and to write downe in a Booke how much it is; for he muſt make them an account, once euery yeere, of all that he hath receiued and diſpurſed.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14140:43"/> And as for Bread, Wine, Wood, and other things that they ſtand in need of, for the prouiſion of their Couents, they haue more beſtowed vpon them than they can well ſpend.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, they haue in euery Towne or City where they dwell, particular benefactors, who giue them a monthly ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and doe ſtill procure them more: for they are of their Fraternity, and partakers (forſooth) of their ſuper-abundant merits. Theſe men haue a ſtocke in money, which they doe priuately, and vnder hand, employ and put out to vſe for the good of theſe holy Friers. Withall they begge twice or thrice a weeke, &amp; in ſome Cities daily, with Wallers and Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ouer their ſhoulders: all that is giuen them, whether it be Fiſh, Fleſh, Bread, Fruits, Herbs, Roots, Spice, ſweet Oile, or any thing elſe, they bring home either on their ſhoulders, or elſe vpon an Aſſe. Where you muſt note, that theſe, and all other begging Friers receiue no ſcraps, but whole Loaues of the pureſt Bread, and of the beſt Wine, and the beſt prouiſion in the houſe. Neither doe they begge in any humble manner, as other poore people, but in an imperiall arrogant ſort, and (without any reuerence) they rather command than craue; and vnleſſe it be good almes, and giuen them with cap and knee, they care not for it: for all theſe
<hi>Monks, Ieſuits,</hi> and <hi>Friers,</hi> rich or poore, are as proud as
<hi>Lucifer,</hi> though not in their Habit, yet in their geſture and behauiour: and if any man paſſe by them, or ſpeake vnto them, without his hat in his hand, and with a low re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence; yea in <hi>Spaine</hi> and
<hi>Italy,</hi> vnleſſe they honour them, and kiſſe the ſleeues of their Habits, they hold them little better than <hi>Lutherans</hi> and Heretikes. Except they be ſome great Perſonages, who indeed are more ceremonious, and obſequious, and doe flatter them more than the common people. And alſo that their Copes, Veſtments, Chalices, and other their Church Vtenſels, are farre from temperature, yea exceeding in ſumptuouſneſſe; let all thoſe that haue ſeene them beare me record if this be not true.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, all <hi>Mendicant</hi> Friers, at their firſt comming to inhabite in any Towne or Citie, will in outward ſhew ſeeme to be Saints, humble, meeke, and good to the poore; the <pb n="78" facs="tcp:14140:44"/> which doth purchaſe them ſuch reputation among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, that they will contribute very liberally towards the building of their Couents, and all other things that they need. In the meane time theſe vnſanctified Fathers (like ſo many Emmets) while the ſeaſon ſerues them, will beſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as being not ignorant of that ſaying of the <hi>Poet:</hi>

               <p>I had an Hoſteſſe at <hi>Orleans</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> that ſent two great Carps in the Lent time, (which coſt her two French crowns) ſod in wine together with a dainty delicious ſawce, for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the <hi>Capuchin</hi> Friers, deſiring them to pray for her, for ſhe was great with childe, and neare her time: And yet ſhee her ſelfe, and her husband, together with their children and family, had but peaſe-pottage, and a few ſalt hearings, for their dinner. But now what did the <hi>Friers</hi> ſend her againe? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, a very holy thing; a little picture of <hi>S.

O the blindneſſe of theſe poore people, that cannot ſee themſelues guld by theſe Impoſtors and Montebanckes!</p>
               <p>Truly the <hi>Capuchin Friers</hi> and their <hi>Nuns,</hi> or holy Siſters whom they call <hi>Capuchineſſes,</hi> yea all the whole rout of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Nuns</hi> and <hi>Friers,</hi> doe profeſſe to liue very auſterely, nay and Angelically, and to ſpend their time in watching, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, faſting, meditations, and alſo puniſhing their bodies, to bring them in ſubiection to the ſpirit. But to ſay the truth, they liue very diſſolutely; for they ſpend the time in banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, quaffing, whoring, cheating, begging and idleneſſe; for I dare boldly ſay, there are no greater drunkards, gluttons, <pb n="80" facs="tcp:14140:45"/> whore-mongers, (yea Sodomites) beggers, Impoſtors and Hypocrites in the vniuerſall world, than they are; for they will eat vntill their panches are ready to cracke; and carowſe vntill they cannot ſee, goe, or ſtand; and then they begin to quarrell and fight, and breake one anothers pate; as for whores, alas, they haue their choiſe, and none of the meaneſt, but rich mens wiues, young virgins, and votary <hi>Nuns:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I could produce here no few examples, but I will forbeare all.

Not long after her brother comming to ſee her, found her dead, who (imagining that her husband had done the deed) flings out of doores, and meeting her husband returning home (hauing not ouertaken the <hi>Frier</hi>) drew his rapier vpon him, and ſo wounded one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to death; ſo that by this meanes, this <hi>Frier</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhamefull fornication, and was the occaſion of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death of theſe foure perſons.</p>

               <p>Another good religious man of this Order, and an

But now againe I will retreat to Father

               <p>Father <hi>Gray,</hi> about fifteene yeares agoe, lodging in one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>V.</hi> his houſe in <hi>Sheere-lane</hi> neare
<hi>Temple-barre,</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> grew ſo farre into his Land-ladies fauour (who was then a young wanton goſſip) that he perſwaded her to breake her vow of wedlocke, and to forſake her wedded husband, and that which is worſt, to yeeld to his carnall deſires, and in ſumme, to forſake all her friends and kinsfolkes, and to follow him. Whereupon, ſhe by his perſwaſions (very fooliſhly) conueyed certaine plate, and other goods, in trunckes and cheſts, priuately away out of her husbands houſe, according to this <hi>Friers</hi> counſell and direction; purpoſing to depart priuately away with this holy Frier vnknowne to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, vnto whom ſhe had formerly vowed both faith and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty. But ſee the ſpight, a <hi>Purſuyuant,</hi> that had intelligence of this Father <hi>Grayes</hi> facultie (though not of his knauery) came and tooke him and his ſweet Land-lady, as they were priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſulting about their iourney, and brought him (albeit he ſpared her for her husband, or rather for her friends ſake) to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and (hauing well peruſed all his letters and notes) he vnderſtood all their knauery. But yet for all this,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14140:46"/> the honeſt woman would not forſake M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gray,</hi> neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he was a poore begging <hi>Frier;</hi> but a Knights bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Northfolke,</hi> whom for honour ſake I will not name; becauſe he is none of their ſect, and one whom I honour; and yet this good
<hi>Frier</hi> afterwards confeſſed, that he neuer knew that Knight, or was any way allied vnto him; but it was true that he told his Land-lady, that he had fiue hundred pounds yearely in good lands in <hi>Northfolke,</hi> and yet he confeſſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that he was neuer there, but was borne in
<hi>Duram.</hi> Oh the chaſtitie and honeſtie of <hi>Monks</hi> and

               <p>Another holy <hi>Frier</hi> of this Order, neare <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> married his brother <hi>Frier,</hi> in the habite of a Scholler, to a rich widowes daughter, making them beleeue he was an heire to great reuenues, and ſent to <hi>Lyons,</hi> as it were, vnder his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telage: but within a while after, the mother and the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcouered his ſhauen crowne, and ſo he was apprehended, and ſent to the Magiſtrates to be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1607. at <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> it was my fortune to fall out with an <hi>Iriſh</hi>-man, whoſe name was Maſter
<hi>Iames Field.</hi> This man in his anger hired two <hi>Picaros,</hi> or Rogues, to murder me: And as I was going thorow a certaine ſtreet home to my lodging, I met with another <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentleman, that loued me, who told me that a friend of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fields,</hi> &amp; one of thoſe <hi>Picaros</hi> were purſuing after me, &amp; that he, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Picaro,</hi> ſtayed at the vpper end of the ſtreet to murder me, and therefore wiſhed me to looke to my ſelfe, or elſe I ſhould hardly eſcape. Whereupon (giuing him many thankes for his friendly loue and warning) I ſtept into a little Church, that was belonging to a certaine Couent of <hi>Nuns</hi> of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Saint <hi>Clare,</hi> who weare the habite of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> and ſate downe in a darke corner of the Church; for it was late,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14140:46"/> and almoſt night, thinking with my ſelfe, that theſe my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would within a while be gone: for they knew not (as I ſuppoſed) that I was there. But within halfe an houre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there came into the ſame Church two <hi>Recollect Friers,</hi> which in <hi>Spaine</hi> they call
<hi>Frayles deſcalcios de San Franciſco,</hi> that is, bare-foot
<hi>Franciſcan Friers:</hi> and hauing ſaid a <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> or an <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> one of them roſe vp, and went vnto an Iron-grate, that was in the lower end of the Church, and there rang a little bell; by and by there came a <hi>Nun</hi> vnto him, and after two or three words of complements, as the faſhion is in thoſe countries, he ſent this
<hi>Nun</hi> to call another <hi>Nun,</hi> who came preſently; who being no ſooner come, but this Religious Father began to hugge or embrace her thorow the grate; and vpon a ſudden the Church doore was (with a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which went thorow the wall into the Couent) locked faſt. When I ſaw how the matter went, and fearing (hauing eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped one danger) leſt I ſhould be diſcouered, and ſo fall into a worſe, and be murdered by theſe
<hi>Nuns</hi> and <hi>Friers;</hi> or at leaſt-wiſe accuſed of
<hi>Sacrilege,</hi> I threw my cloake ouer my head, (for feare they ſhould perceiue my band) and ſate as quiet and as mute as a fiſh, making as though I ſlept. In the meane time both the <hi>Friers</hi> got into the Couent, but which way I know not; for there was neuer a doore for them to enter; and beſides, my cloake was ouer my eyes that I could not ſee: but this I am ſure, that I ſaw them both within the grate, and foure or fiue
<hi>Nuns</hi> whiſpering together, for I could not heare their diſcourſe. From thence they went to ſome other place, and what they did I know not, but leaue it vnto others to conſider. For my part, I was conſtrained for mine owne ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſtay there vntill the next morning; and as ſoone as the doore was open, I departed, and was neuer diſcouered.</p>
               <p>In the moneth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1613. I was comming from
<hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> towards <hi>Netherland,</hi> and at <hi>Padua</hi> I met with a young man named <hi>Cornelius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ander Brugg,</hi> borne (as he ſaid) neare
<hi>Berg Saint Wenego</hi> in <hi>Flanders.</hi> This man was trauelling the ſelfe-ſame way, as I was, and was very glad of my company, and my ſelfe likewiſe of his: and ſo trauelling on our iourney we came within foure or fiue miles of <hi>Trent,</hi> and by reaſon <pb n="84" facs="tcp:14140:47"/> the heat was ſo great, that wee could not trauell any further vntill the cooleneſſe of the euening, wee ſlept a little out of the way into a thicket of buſhes, to refreſh our ſelues in the ſhade, vntil the heat of the day was paſt; where we had not bin very long, but we fell both aſleepe. About two houres after, I heard ſome people hard by in the ſame thicket, quarrelling and railing, as if they had beene ſo many Tankard-bearers at Holborne-conduit. I wondered who they were; and was halfe afraid they were <hi>Banditi,</hi> or Robbers by the high way; yet creeping vpon my hands and knees, ſoftly thorow the thicket, I eſpied there ſix <hi>Capuchin Friers,</hi> ſitting downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, with good meat before them, and each of them with a great wine-bottle by him; two of them were <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi> and the reſt
<hi>Italians.</hi> The quarrell was about a bottle of ſweet wine, that was drunke vp by ſome of them while the others ſlept. The <hi>Italians</hi> accuſed the <hi>Germaines,</hi> and they ſtood vpon their
<hi>Innocencie;</hi> one of them a luſtie tall <hi>Frier,</hi> ſwore in the
<hi>Dutch</hi> tongue, by an hundred thouſand Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that he would beat two of the other <hi>Friers,</hi> as ſoone as they came into
<hi>Dutch-land;</hi> for they were going towards <hi>Bauaria</hi> and
<hi>Auſtria;</hi> but the <hi>Italians</hi> vnderſtood him not. I came backe to my friend, and awaked him, and brought him to the place where I had formerly beene, that he might both heare and ſee them: who bleſſing himſelfe, ſtood ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſee the <hi>Capuchin Friers</hi> (whom he thought to haue bin Demi-ſaints) to raile and wrangle in that ſort for a bottle of wine, and would haue reproued them, if I had not very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intreated him to the contrary. In the end they aroſe vp, and would haue fought, if the other two had not ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and perſwaded them to be quiet. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they departed. Within a quarter of an houre after we alſo went on our iourney, and ouertooke them, ſtill brawling and quarrelling: But when one of them had perceiued vs to be ſo neare, and had giuen them notice, they began to recite their <hi>Canonicall houres,</hi> and one of them ſaid, or rather roared out, <hi>Deus in adiutorium meum intende,</hi> and the reſt anſwered, <hi>Domine ad iuuandum me feſtina;</hi> and ſo proceeded on in the repetition of their houres, of purpoſe to make vs beleeue, that <pb n="85" facs="tcp:14140:47"/> they were praying, and not railing and fighting: for they knew not that we were in the Thicket with them. And ſo we ſaluted them, and paſſed on our iourney, but my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (being a Romiſh Catholike) was aſhamed to ſee their hypocriſie; and ſwore, that if he had not ſeene and heard all that paſt betweene them, he would neuer haue beleeued the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> of all other Friers, to be ſuch gourmans and great hypocrites.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Frier at <hi>Tournay,</hi> was one of them that perſwaded a villaine to kill the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> telling him that his fact was commendable and meritorious; and ſo aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that if he were put to death for the ſame, <hi>In Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrum numero collocatumiri,</hi> he ſhould be counted a Martyr.</p>
               <p>Theſe idle lazie-packs are not good for any honeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, as the Emperour, <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, teſtified of them: for when the Generall of their Order in a <hi>brauado,</hi> offered two and twenty thouſand Friers to aſſiſt him in his warres, none aboue forty, or vnder two and twenty yeeres old; the Emperour anſwered, <hi>That he would not haue them; by reaſon that he ſhould haue need of two and twenty thouſand Fleſh-pots:</hi> intimating thereby, that they are fitter, by farre, for the Kitchin, than for any labour or ſeruice.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Orleans,</hi> a City in <hi>France,</hi> a Preſidents wife died, who was a noble vertuous woman;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sleydan. lib. 9.</hi>
                  </note> and vpon her death-bed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that they ſhould carry her to be buried without light, without any Maſſes, ſinging the office of the dead, or any other pompe or ceremonies as the Papiſts vſe; as indeed ſhe was buried in the Monaſtery of the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friers. But ſee what followed: within a few daies after they began to heare in that place horrible noiſes, vntill one of theſe Maſſe-mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers ſhewed the people the breaden god. When this was once ſpread abroad among the people, one ſaid he heard it, one ſaid he vnderſtood it, and another ſaid he ſaw all.</p>
               <p>The Preſident (being the womans Husband) hearing this, came thither himſelfe: then one of the Friers beginne to coniure and binde the ſpirit to anſwer to his queſtions; and asked if ſhe were in
<hi>Paradiſe?</hi> and there was no anſwer made. He asked if ſhe were in
<hi>Hell?</hi> and yet there was no <pb n="86" facs="tcp:14140:48"/> anſwer. In the end, he asked if ſhe came from <hi>Purgatory?</hi> and then the Spirit made a great noiſe againſt the wall. Then did the coniuring Frier aske the ſpirit, if he was ſuch a one? naming many and ſundry perſons that were dead long agoe, and yet there was no anſwer heard, nor any noiſe; but when he named the woman that was buried without pompe, then the Spirit made two great ruſhings againſt the wall.

               <p>THeſe <hi>Friers</hi> are called by the name of <hi>Friers of our bleſſed Lady of the Fullians.</hi> They weare a courſe Habit of white cloth. This Congregation beganne about that time that King <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France</hi> was murdered by <hi>Iacques Clement,</hi> a
<hi>Dominican</hi> Frier, which was about the yeere 1587. they are of the Order of the <hi>Ciſtercenſis,</hi> whereof I formerly ſpake. They liued very obſcure, vntill ſuch time that King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of
<hi>France</hi> was likewiſe murdered by <hi>Francis Rauillac,</hi> in the yeere 1610. ſince which time they built them ſumptuous Monaſteries and gaudy Churches in all the chiefeſt Cities in <hi>France;</hi> and are in great credit and eſtimation, eſpecially among great Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, with whom they are (if you will beleeue the other
<hi>Mendicant</hi> Friers) too familiar. They haue a faire Cloiſter, and a fine delicate Church at <hi>Paris,</hi> and alſo in moſt Cities of
<hi>France</hi> (and no where elſe) built by great Ladies, who doe reſort there daily to heare Maſſe and Sermons, and to haue ſome other ſpirituall conference with theſe holy Fathers. The other rout or rabble of old begging Friers cry out with wide mouthes vpon theſe new vpſtart Sects; for they ſay, that they doe ſeduce their Benefactors to beſtow vpon them, the charity and beneuolence, which they were wont to haue, and therefore they are ready to ſtarue. But to ſay the truth, theſe ſeuerall Sects of
<hi>Mendicant</hi> Friers haue vndone the poore; for they are increaſed of late to ſo many Sects, that the poore people can get nothing becauſe of them. For in thoſe Catholike Countries, the Pariſhioners are not taxed or conſtrained, to pay towards the reliefe of their poore, as the manner is in
<hi>England,</hi> or among the Proteſtants in thoſe Countries. But the Friers ſay, Giue vs your beneuolence, and <pb n="92" facs="tcp:14140:51"/> we will beſtow vpon the poore. And by this meanes the poore are neglected, and theſe Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> well fed and prouided for.</p>

<hi>Peter,</hi> the eternall <hi>Father,</hi> and his <hi>Son</hi> carrying his croſſe, appeared vnto him. And the reaſon was, (ſaith the Author) becauſe it arriued vnto him at his death, as it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riueth vnto great potentates of the earth: As long as a King is in his Palaces and houſes of pleaſure, the Guard ſuffer none to enter, but men of note, vnleſſe it be ſome neceſſarie attendants: but when the King is dead, and that he is laid on an Hearſe in the great Hall of the Court, then euery one is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come in.

<hi>Popes,</hi> as <hi>S. Peter; Empereſſes,</hi> as the <hi>Mother</hi> of God; or ſome Souereigne <hi>Monarch,</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> and his
<hi>Sonne,</hi> which had the fauour to behold him: but as ſoone as he was dead, euery Courtier belonging to the Eternall King was admitted, all the celeſtiall people ran to ſee him, <hi>Angells, Archangells, Thrones,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is now among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as it was heretofore among the Heathen people: for they had many gods, as <hi>Apollo, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, Mars, Mercury, Aeolus, Neptune, Pan, Cupid,</hi> &amp;c. And goddeſſes likewiſe, as <hi>Minerua, Pallas, Venus,</hi> and the like.

               <p>Among all other Orders, of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers,</hi> though the Common-wealths (wherein they liue) are exceedingly exhauſted by them in matters of charge (eſpecially in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the

               <p>Their Churches are rich and ſumptuous; their moueables and houſhold-ſtuffe magnificent, rather than decent, their gardens pleaſant, ſpacious, and delightfull, their garments fine and comely; <hi>Hi patres nigri, ſunt ſemper benè veſtiti:</hi> Their geſture proud and ſtately; their fare plentifull, and of the beſt: And in fine, they are not tied to any riſing in the night to their deuotion, or the like hardneſſe, to which other <hi>Friers</hi> and Religious Orders are ſubiect: for they goe (or may goe) to bed at eight of the clocke at night, and riſe betweene fiue and ſix in the morning.

               <p>Their firſt Maſſe beginnes about eight of the clocke in the morning, and a priuate Maſſe doth continue not aboue halfe an houre.

Vnto which a
<hi>Ieſuite</hi> comes forth, ſo attended on by Nouices, and in as great grauity (or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit holineſſe) as the Pope himſelfe, when he is in his <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificalibus.</hi>

                     <l>
                        <hi>Quo ſemel eſt imbuta recens ſeruabit odorem</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Teſta diù.—</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That is to ſay, <hi>The veſſell will long retaine, the taſte of the firſt liquor it firſt held or contained.</hi> Which is vndoubtedly of no ſmall moment to the ſtrengthening and vpholding of their faction and ſociety.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, ſometimes (as occaſion and opportunity ſo falls out) they doe perſwade ſuch of their Schollers as are rich, and that haue their meanes in their diſpoſing (their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents being dead) to enter into their Order or ſociety, and to giue and enfeoffe all that they haue vpon their Colleges whereof I could bring here many examples. There dwelt heretofore in <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>Portugall</hi> a very rich Merchant, that had no more children than two ſonnes, who went to Schoole to the <hi>Ieſuites;</hi> whereof the youngeſt they had perſwaded (ſecretly and vnknowne to the father) to make a ſolemne vow to be one of their ſociety, and to giue them all that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that his Father ſhould bequeath him. It fortuned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a yeere or two that this Merchant fell ſicke, and being paſt all hope of recouery made his Will, and bequeath'd all his eſtate betweene his two ſonnes, giuing vnto the elder brother the better part. The
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> (whom in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try they call <hi>Apoſtolos, Apoſtles</hi>) hearing how the matter <pb n="103" facs="tcp:14140:56"/> ſtood, preſently repaired vnto this ſicke man, vnder colour to adminiſter vnto him ſome ſpirituall comfort; and there they dealt ſo cunningly with him, that they perſwaded him that his eldeſt ſonne was a very deboiſt young man, and giuen to many vices, and ſuch a one as would ſpend and waſte all that he had giuen him; and extolled and applauded the youngeſt for a vertuous religious youth, a good Scholler, and one that would ſurely be a good man, and a great prop or ſtay to his family or kindred; ſo that by their iugling tricks they got the ſicke man to reuoke his former Wil, and to make a new Will, and to bequeath the moſt part of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance vpon his youngeſt ſonne, which being done, the man ſhortly after died, and the
<hi>Ieſuits</hi> receiued the younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into their ſociety, but not as yet publikely but priuately.</p>
               <p>Within two daies after, when the dead Corpſe was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to be buried, the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> put ſome of their ſociety, and the younger brother, and ſouldiers well armed to keepe poſſeſſion in the Merchants houſe; whom when the elder brother, vpon his returne home from his father buriall (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether ignorant of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> fraud, in procuring his Father to make a new Will) ſaw, demanded of them what they did there, and would haue entred into the houſe; they bade him ſtand backe, telling him that they were put there to keepe poſſeſſion for the
<hi>Apoſtles.</hi> For the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſaid he, I thinke verily if our <hi>Sauiour Chriſt</hi> had had ſuch warlike <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> he had neuer beene taken by the high Prieſt, and the Scribes and Phariſes, and ſo euill entreated as hee was. In <hi>fine,</hi> he was conſtrained to take what it pleaſed the <hi>Ignatian</hi> Apoſtles to giue him; and they had the moſt part of the Merchants ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>It is a thing worth the obſeruing, to ſee how buſie and diligent they are when they heare of a wealthy man or woman that lieth ſicke and in danger of death. This is their chiefeſt harueſt and <hi>Optimae praeda.</hi> Then they commend vnto him the pouerty of their College, and the merit he ſhall gaine by dealing liberally with them, as being for euer to be remembred in their Maſſes, as one of their Benefactors. The
<hi>Mendicant</hi> Friers, eſpecially the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> and they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14140:57"/> haue beene in Law together in <hi>Spaine</hi> for many yeeres, about this viſitation of the ſicke men, <hi>in articulo mortis.</hi> The <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> ſaid that it appertained vnto them; becauſe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is <hi>actiue,</hi> and to be alwaies ſtirring among the flocke, and to doe good to the world abroad: whereas that of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> and the other begging Friers, was
<hi>contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi> and ſo by conſequence moſt decent that they ſhould containe themſelues within their Cloiſters. The <hi>Friers</hi> on the other ſide replied, that their profeſſion was Meekneſſe, Innocency, Pouerty, and to doe good vnto all men. As for the
<hi>Ieſuites,</hi> that they are <hi>proud, ambitious, aſpiring, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medlers in matters of ſtate, men of great riches, and couetous of more, and therefore by no meanes to be admitted to ſuch as lie at the point of death.</hi> The matter hath beene much ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued of, and greatly debated in
<hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> And all the other Orders of <hi>Monks,</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> were, and ſtill are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently againſt them; and they haue beene openly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed againſt in the publike Schooles of moſt of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities of <hi>Italy, Spaine, France, Netherland</hi> and
<hi>Germany:</hi> yet notwithſtanding they are ſo ſtrongly backt by the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> (whoſe turne they ſerue againe in other matters) that howſoeuer the cry goe againſt them, they preuaile and hold their owne ſtill.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, they haue ſo cunningly wrought, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they are, they onely are the generall hearers of all Confeſſions, diuing thereby into the ſecrets and drifts of all men, acquainting themſelues (as I ſaid before) with their humours and imperfections, and making (as time and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſerues) their owne vſe and benefit. And yet if ſome poore perſon come vnto them to confeſſe, they will ſeldome or neuer heare his confeſſion; and if they doe, they will hardly abſolue him of his ſinnes. As for examples ſake, a certaine Gentle in <hi>Madrid</hi> in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> to try whether the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> would confeſſe poore folkes, ſent his man vpon a time to their College, in the night time, to intreat them they would ſend one of their Fathers to confeſſe a poore man that lay a dying in the ſtreet (albeit there was no ſuch matter) but the Porter told him, that all the good Fathers <pb n="105" facs="tcp:14140:57"/> were gone to take their reſt and could not come: by and by he ſent another man to intreat them to come to receiue the confeſſion of a great rich
<hi>Cauallero,</hi> whom they knew to haue laine ſick for a long time; whereupon two of them came forth preſently, but when they were a little from home, his men, by his appointment, beat the two <hi>Ieſuites</hi> ſoundly and tooke away their clokes from them.</p>
               <p>But by the way, ſeeing it comes ſo well to our purpoſe, I wil tell you a pretty ſtory that hapned heretofore in the Low Countries. A Merchant, whoſe name was <hi>Hamyel,</hi> being ſicke at <hi>Antwerpe</hi> of a conſumption, the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> knowing him to be a man of great poſſeſſions, and without children, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently repaired vnto him vnder colour of ſpirituall conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, laying before him the vanity of this life, and the glory of the world to come; with ſundry other perſwaſions, as of all men liuing, they haue their tongues moſt at will: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending vnto him their Order, as of all other the moſt meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, perfect, and acceptable to God, and to which their holy Father the Pope, and his Predeceſſors, haue granted more Indulgences than to any other order of Religion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. In ſo much that they brought the poore man (being of himſelfe ſimple) into their Society, thinking there was no other way to be ſaued: ſo as before hand he infeoffed their College with his land, which was two hundred pounds a yeere, giuing them much goods and rich moueables; and when he had ſo done, died within three moneths after the ſame. His next heires, by counſell of their friends, put the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> in ſuit; againſt which, though they oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with all vehemency, yet to their great ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, ſentence was giuen againſt them by the Royall Councell of <hi>Mechlin;</hi> which Court hath authority to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine definitely, both in ciuill and criminall cauſes without appeale. Notwithſtanding they would not ſo giue ouer, but by the meanes, aid, and ſupport of one <hi>Pamele,</hi> a Preſident &amp; chiefe Fauourite of theirs, they appealed from thence to the Councell of Eſtate at
<hi>Bruxels,</hi> getting the cauſe after ſentence giuen to be remoued; a thing there vnuſuall, and ſcarcely euer heard of before, where the proceſſe was hanging for a <pb n="106" facs="tcp:14140:58"/> long time: yet afterwards the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> to their great ſhame, were conſtrained to compound with their aduerſaries.</p>
               <p>Another time, a rich and wealthy Merchant of the ſame City, whoſe name was <hi>Iohn Baptiſta Spinola,</hi> a man then knowne in moſt Merchant Townes in Chriſtendom, but one in that point, whoſe deuotion and ſcrupuloſity ouerwent his wiſdome, comming to them to confeſſion, &amp; telling them of ſome vniuſt gaine, with which he felt his conſcience touched; they preſently (with ſundry terrifying ſpeeches) told him that he was in the ſtate of damnation, out of which he could not be deliuered, vntill ſuch time that hee had made reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well of that confeſſed, as of all other money and goods that he had by vſury vnlawfully gotten, laying before him, <hi>Quod non dimittitur peccatum, niſi reſtituatur ablatum:</hi> with ſundry other ſuch ſentences, whereof they haue good ſtore. In <hi>fine,</hi> they put the man into ſuch feare of conſcience, that he yeelded to make reſtitution, if ſo the ſame might bee done without his vndoing, diſcredit, or ſhame. Whereupon to comfort him againe, but indeed fearing leſt if they dealt too rigorouſly and roughly with him, they ſhould get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; they told him, that if in ſtead of all ſuch intereſts and vſuries, with which he found his conſcience burdened, hee onely would bee content to deliuer vnto them ſome ſuch ſumme of money, as without his vndoing, he thought hee might conueniently ſpare, they would take it vpon their ſoules, to ſee the ſumme imployed vpon good, vertuous, and charitable vſes, to the greater merit and benefit of his ſoule, and as a thing more acceptable vnto God, and leſſe ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the world, than if hee ſhould make reſtitution to whom it appertained, and had beene by his vſury in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed. Whereupon the Merchant being well ſatisfied in conſcience, gaue them the money, and they him their abſolution. The <hi>Capuchins</hi> afterwards made great ſuit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Merchant to become a religious man of their Order, and to make a diſtribution of his goods among them: hee made great ſhew to be very willing for a while, but in the and he deceiued them, and falling to his old
<hi>bias,</hi> did not ſticke to tell vnto ſome of his priuate friends this former tale, <pb n="107" facs="tcp:14140:58"/> and by that meanes the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> iugling came to light.</p>
               <p>They haue perſwaded the laſt Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> this Dukes Father, to become one of their Society, and to make them a College of his owne Palace at <hi>Monachum,</hi> to build them a ſtately Church, all the Pillars, Arches, and the Porches being of fine Marble, and the whole Church couered ouer with fine Copper, adorned within &amp; without with many curious and coſtly Images, Pictures, Tablets, and the Vtenſels belonging to the Altars of gold and ſiluer, Copes and Veſtments of cloth of gold, cloth of tiſſue, and curious imbroideries. And withall to infeoffe whole Townes, Caſtles, and Mannors vpon their new College; his ſonne and heire being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to liue in a meane houſe in the ſame towne, with ſuch ſmall penſion as his father had formerly aſſured vpon him. And albeit the old Ieſuited Duke had ſurrendred this gouernment of the Country vnto him, at his firſt entering into their Society, yet he durſt not doe any thing without the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> aduice and approbation.</p>
               <p>The old Duke (being a ſilly, zealous, ſimple, well minded Prince) was wont to entertaine into certaine Chambers, or Lodgings in his Court (appointed for that purpoſe) all ſuch Pilgrims as trauelled that way, with meat, drinke, and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the beſt, for three daies and three nights: and this was the manner of their entertainment. At the gates of the Towne, among the Souldiers that had the guard, for it is a Gariſon Towne, there were certaine Officers to receiue all ſuch Pilgrims as had good Letters of commendation, or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony that they were Romiſh Catholikes, and bound to
<hi>Rome,</hi> or any other place of pilgrimage vpon deuotion, or elſe returning homewards, which Officer was to conduct theſe Pilgrims preſently vpon their arriuall to a certaine lodging in the Dukes Court, where was another man of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to receiue them; but before that they entred into their lodgings, they were brought into a roome, where euery man had deliuered vnto him a cleane Shirt, a long Waſtcoat made of red Cotton, a paire of new blacke Canuaſſe breeches, a paire of new linnen Stockins, a paire of Slippers, a blacke Gowne, a Girdle, a blacke Cap, and a little ſticke in his hand:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14140:59"/> for they were to put off all their owne clothes, and to put on theſe, which being done, they were ſhewed the way to the Church, there to ſay a few <hi>Aues</hi> and <hi>Paters,</hi> and then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their lodging to dinner or ſupper, according to the time of the day that they came thither. Theſe poore men had meat ſent them from the Dukes owne Table, and ſerued in by his ſeruants, and the beſt Wine and Beere that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try did yeeld; beſides, euery man lay alone in a good Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-bed, with ſweet freſh linnen (more like a noble man than a Pilgrim) where they remained for the ſpace of three daies and ſo many nights. Moreouer, the Duke came himſelfe ſometimes, and waſhed theſe poore mens feet in warme wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſweet herbs, and dryed the ſame with ſweet damaske Napkins: when they were to depart, they had Shirts, Shooes, thoſe Stockins and Breeches which they had formerly worne, a Pilgrims ſtaffe, and money in their Purſe according to their wants and quality.</p>
               <p>And when the Duke became a <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> it was agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them that the Pilgrims ſhould haue the ſelfe ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment there for euer; which indeed they had as long as he liued. But as ſoone as euer the breath was out of his body (albeit they had meanes giuen vnto them by the Duke, not onely for their owne maintenance, more than that was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but alſo to entertaine the Pilgrims) theſe vnconſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<hi>Machiuillians,</hi> who can neuer abide any poore body, gaue ſtraight order at euery gate of the Towne, that no Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, or any other poore man ſhould come in, but ſend their Letters vnto them, the which if they like of, they marke with a priuate marke, that they may know if they come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe, and then they write their names and Country in their bookes of Record, and perhaps ſend theſe poore creatures three pence or a groat, after ſuch time that they make them attend three or foure houres for it. The
<hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and ſome <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> that did vſe to goe that way to <hi>Rome,</hi> doe giue them many a bitter curſe for their vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable dealings with them: but they care not, for there is none there that can controll them: nay, this Duke dare not offend them, and whatſoeuer they doe or ſay, is a Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:14140:59"/>They haue at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> in
<hi>Aquitania,</hi> built their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege vpon the land belonging to an
<hi>Hoſpitall,</hi> that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the Pilgrims that goe to Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>Compoſtella;</hi> and in the end, becauſe they would enlarge their College, they pulled downe the <hi>Hoſpitall,</hi> and got into their hands all the reuenues thereof, vndertaking to the Magiſtrates of the Towne, and ouerſeers of the <hi>Hoſpitall,</hi> to maintaine the ſame in farre better manner than it was kept before. But now theſe Vſurpers will admit none to haue a nights lodging there, but ſuch as haue ſpeciall Letters of recommendations from ſome of their Society. All which I know to be true; for I haue beene told by more than a hundred poore Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims of ſeuerall Nations, of theſe their vnchriſtian-like dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrates and Clergy of <hi>Turnay</hi> in the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> would not by any meanes receiue them into their Towne, albeit they had the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Letters Patents. In the end, vnder hand, they got one of their Factors, an <hi>Antwerpian</hi> Merchant, to buy them one of the faireſt houſes in the Citie, and a whole rew of houſes beſides; where they built their Schooles, and taught maugre all the Magiſtrates, the
<hi>Biſhop,</hi> and all the <hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> and Clergy men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. Yea, they haue there now two Colleges and a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, where they lodge and boord Noblemen, Gentlemen, and rich mens children, which brings them in no ſmal profit.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrates and Citizens of the Towne of <hi>Iſle</hi> or <hi>Riſſel, alias Inſula,</hi> in the confines of <hi>Flanders,</hi> receiued the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> into their City with ſuch honour and reſpect as is to be admired at, and yet they required their kinde courteſies moſt baſely. Firſt, the Magiſtrates and the inhabitants aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them an annuall rent of about two hundred pounds ſterling. And becauſe that there was no ſpare place in the Towne that the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> did like of to ſet vp their reſt, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, with the common conſent and charges of all the Citizens, about the yeere
1608. brake downe a great part of of the wall, rampier, and a great bulwarke of the towne, and damped or filled vp the Mote, and tooke in aboue a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred acres of ground into the Towne, incloſing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14140:60"/> it againe with a high ſtrong brick wall, rampiers, bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes and another mote, and there built them vpon their proper coſt and charges a goodly ſumptuous College, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Schooles, furniſhed with fine pleaſant Gardens, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards and walkes, yea with all neceſſary offices, in ſo much that they brought water into euery office in the College. I omit to ſpeake of a maruellous faire Church, adorned with all neceſſary vtenſills thereunto belonging. And all this in leſſe ſpace than two yeares.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, this new plot (which was thus taken in) was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided among the chiefeſt men of the Towne, where they built the goodlieſt houſes in all the Citie, becauſe (forſooth) they would be neare theſe holy Fathers, to haue their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all comfort, and conſolation in time of need. The <hi>Ieſuits</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus ſeated and ſetled like Princes; the firſt thing was that they did, to requite the Citizens great loue, and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry charges. They procured vnto themſelues from the King of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> the Archduke, &amp; the Archducheſſe Letters Patents, that they ſhould haue for euery barrell of beere that is drawn within that Town two ſhillings nine pence farthing, which is for euery quart pot two
<hi>Liards,</hi> or halfe a <hi>Stiuer,</hi> which is about an halfe-peny halfe farthing <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and doth amount to a great ſumme of mony yearly, conſidering the greatneſſe of the Towne, and the multitude of the people that are the Inhabitants thereof. Albeit the Aſſiſe which they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to pay (before that time) for their beere, was as much in equall portion, to the King, and the Archduke, as they did pay to the Brewer; from which the poore begger was not free, but if he did drinke, he paid ſo much vnto the King, as he did to the Victualer. And yet theſe vnconſcionable and couetous <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> did for their benefit and better mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, procure this other impoſition to be laid vpon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, notwithſtanding the former extraordinary loue and kindneſſe which they receiued from them: Both which aſſiſe of the beere, the poore inhabitants haue beene conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to pay euer ſince, as well to the King, as to the
<hi>Ieſuites;</hi> by means whereof, and other their politike cheating and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenage, they are become not only exceeding rich, but alſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14140:60"/> to all the Townes and Countrey there adioyning.</p>
               <p>And beſides, whereas the inhabitants of this Towne, had been for many hundred yeares free, and exempt from all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture or confiſcation of their lands and goods to the King, if any of them had committed any felony, murder, treaſon, or the like; their bodies being only liable to the Law, and not their lands or goods. Now theſe <hi>Ieſuites</hi> (perceiuing that the State-houſe, the Towne Charter, and all the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Towne had beene ſome certaine yeares before burnt, by occaſion of fire) procured vnder-hand a Patent to be granted to their College, of all forfeitures and confiſcations whatſoeuer, that ſhould happen to fall due to the King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Towne and the liberties thereof; and hauing ſo done, they began to ſeize vpon the land and goods of all ſuch as were conuicted for any of theſe or the like crimes or offences. The Magiſtrates of the Towne, and all the reſt of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, with one conſent did oppoſe the
<hi>Ieſuites,</hi> as intruders, vſurpers, and common perturbers of their Priuileges and Liberties: whereupon the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> commenced their ſute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Magiſtrates, and all the inhabitants of the Towne, in the higher Courts; wherein the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> would haue ſurely preuailed, if that a certaine Religious man (as I thinke) a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Regular</hi> of the Order of <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> that liued in an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey about ſix miles from the Towne (and yet in the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the ſame) had not found out in the Library there, an old booke of Hiſtories or Antiquities in <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> written many hundred yeares ſince; wherein was contained, among other things, a Copie of the Charter of this Towne of <hi>Lyſle:</hi> which being ſhewed vnto the Councell of State, the
<hi>Ieſuits,</hi> with much ſhame &amp; diſgrace, had a definitiue ſentence giuen againſt them, neuer afterwards to intermedle with the Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and Statutes of the Towne, and to pay coſt and charges beſides.
<hi>Oh the honeſtie of theſe holy men of the ſociety of Ieſus!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn Chaſtell</hi> was taught and perſwaded by the
<hi>Ieſuites,</hi> to murder <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> and yet ſome <hi>Papiſts</hi> would deny it, if they could, becauſe they are loth to make the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> odious: and yet others did helpe to erect a pillar of ſtone neare to the Kings Palace in <hi>Paris,</hi> whereby ſo much <pb n="112" facs="tcp:14140:61"/> was ſignified. But the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> when they were recalled againe into <hi>France,</hi> from their baniſhment, got leaue of the King (vpon the Queenes requeſt) to deface it, ſome few yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King was murdered by <hi>Rauillacke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the yeare 1607. The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> procured the Emperour
<hi>Rodulphus,</hi> to preſcribe that ancient Imperiall City
<hi>Donawert</hi> in high <hi>Germany,</hi> and to giue it in prey vnto the Duke of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaria,</hi> who came priuately with foure or fiue thouſand men, and tooke it and ranſacked it, and afterwards put a ſtrong gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon therein, altering their Lawes and Cuſtomes, and debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them of all their former Priuileges whatſoeuer, in ſo much that the chiefeſt men in the Citie, were conſtrained to abandon both houſe and home, and to ſeeke after another place to inhabite. I came thorow this Citie within three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths after that the Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> had taken it; and it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued my heart to ſee into what miſerable bondage the poore Citizens were brought, and all through the deuilliſh practiſe of theſe irreligious <hi>Machiauills,</hi> who then did tyrannize ouer them, like ſo many <hi>Turks</hi> or
<hi>Infidels;</hi> for they managed the whole affaires of the Citie, the Gouernour which the Duke had placed there ouer the ſouldiers, ſtood but for a cipher; for he durſt doe nothing without the conſent of the
<hi>Ieſuits.</hi> The Magiſtrates were all put out of their charge &amp; offices; &amp; other baſe, poore, mechanicall fellowes appointed in their places, farre vnworthy the high dignitie of <hi>Conſuls</hi> or
<hi>Burghemaſters</hi> in ſuch an ancient free and noble City as that is. The ſouldiers were billeted in all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> houſes, and not in any <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> houſe, where they dominierd like ſo many deuills, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hauock of all that they could come by; and yet the
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> were conſtrained to pay them their wages beſides. What ſhall I ſay? The <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> in effect, did command and controll the whole Citie, as they pleaſed. They baniſhed their Miniſters, and compelled the inhabitants either to goe to heare Maſſe, contrary to their conſciences; or elſe forſake the Citie, and liue in exile. And yet this is nothing in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of
<hi>Aquiſgranum</hi> haue endured, and yet doe ſuffer.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> (ſurnamed the <hi>Great</hi>) hunting <pb n="113" facs="tcp:14140:61"/> vpon a time in the Foreſt of <hi>Arden,</hi> found out certaine Bathes or hot waters, in which place he built a very faire Citie, and called it <hi>Aquiſgranum,</hi> and gaue it many priuileges and great freedome: among other things, he ordained that all other Emperours, his Succeſſours, ſhould be crowned there, and that the <hi>Imperiall Diadem</hi> (which is now kept at <hi>Franckfurt</hi> vpon <hi>Main</hi>) ſhould be kept in this Citie. Here likewiſe hee built (among other Churches) a very faire Collegiat Church, endowing it with great reuenues; within a Chappell of this Church the craftie Clergie men (obſeruing the ignorance of the people in thoſe daies) ſet vp an <hi>Image</hi> of the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> which they affirmed to worke great miracles, by meanes whereof, and of the hot Bathes, this Citie came to be very famous, and haunted by many people; for many that were viſited with ſickneſſe and diſeaſes, came from farre and neare to this <hi>vp-ſtart Lady,</hi> and the <hi>Bathes.</hi> Beſides, all the Copper that is brought from the vpper parts of <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Netherland,</hi> or theſe parts, is firſt brought thither to be refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. In fine, when the miſtie fogges of ſuperſtition began to diſperſe, and the glorious ſun-ſhine of the Goſpell to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, it pleaſed God in this Citie (among others the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Townes and Prouinces) to call ſome to the true knowledge of his word, in ſo much that the moſt part of the inhabitants thereof (the
<hi>Monks, Friers, Nuns,</hi> and the other Clergy men excepted) in a ſhort time became Proteſtants, and had Miniſters, and a Church in the middeſt of the Citie. The <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> perceiuing how the number of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> began to increaſe daily more and more; that this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit <hi>Lady</hi> was fallen ſicke, and could worke no more mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, becauſe the <hi>Proteſtant Miniſters</hi> had diſcouered their deceits and trumperies, and ſpoiled their market; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that the people came not with their offertories vnto them, as in former times; which was to their no ſmall loſſe and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance; They (I ſay) plotted how to preuent this danger, and firſt they intended to bring the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> into the City, but this could not be; for the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> were more in number than they; and withall, there was an equall number of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of either Religion: for there were two
<hi>Proteſtant Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghemaſters,</hi> 
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:14140:62"/> and two
<hi>Papiſts.</hi> Then they practiſed how to betray the Citie to the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> but their treacherie was diſcouered; and the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> betaking themſelues to their armes, preuented it; and the Duke of <hi>Cleue</hi> (who was then Protector of the Citie) at their requeſt, put in a garriſon of ſouldiers to defend them from the King of
<hi>Spaines</hi> forces; who neuer after attempted any thing againſt the Citie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till after the Duke of <hi>Cleues</hi> death; at which time by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous plots of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> who were priuately lurking there, ſent an armie ſecretly vnder the conduct of <hi>Spinola,</hi> and tooke the Citie by treachery, and not by force of armes, or valour; and ſets a garriſon of foure thouſand men therein, all billeted or lodged in
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> houſes; and they themſelues conſtrained to abandon the City, or elſe to liue no better than thoſe that liue vnder the cruell tyrannie of the <hi>Turks.</hi> And as for the Miniſters, ſome they put to death, others eſcaped away to <hi>Holland,</hi> and other parts. Thoſe of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that euer had beene <hi>Burghemaſters,</hi> that they found, they put likewiſe to death, and many other of the Townſmen, that at any time withſtood them, vpon any former tumults or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, fared no better.</p>
               <p>I came to this Citie in the moneth of December 1616. where the next day I beheld (to my no ſmall ſorrow) a moſt lamentable tragedie, which was as followeth. As I would haue departed away, I could not, becauſe the Ports or Gates were locked, and all the ſouldiers in the Towne (but onely thoſe that had the watch) drawne (in their full compleat armes) to the Market-place, which is very ſpatious, &amp; as big as <hi>Smithfield</hi> in
<hi>London.</hi> In which Market-place, there was a ſcaffold ſet vp hard by the State-houſe; vnto the which they brought a proper young man (about ſix and twentie yeares of age) bound, hauing a <hi>Ieſuite</hi> on either ſide, who mounting the ſcaffold, with a very ſweet and chearefull countenance, kneeled downe, and ſaid a ſhort mentall prayer; then riſing and looking about him, eſpied a friend of his, hard by the ſcaffold, vnto whom he caſt his cloake, intreating him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it vnto his wife; who was in a corner of the Market-place a farre off, together with many other women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <pb n="115" facs="tcp:14140:62"/> vpon their knees, making the moſt lamentable noiſe that euer I heard, and deſiring God to iudge their cauſe. This man lifting vp his hands, pulled off his hat, and making a low reuerence towards thoſe women, and many other <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that ſtood by them, with a loud voice deſired them all to pray for him; and deſired God to forgiue him all his ſinnes, for Chriſt his ſake; ſignifying further vnto them, that the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> had promiſed to ſaue his life, if ſo be that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his ſinnes, and receiue the Sacrament, the which (ſaid he) I did, being drawne thereunto by their faire promiſes and perſwaſions, and the entire loue I bare to my wife, children, and kinsfolkes. But now I am heartily ſory for it; and then kneeling downe again, asked God &amp; the Reformed Church (with teares) forgiueneſſe, for (ſaid he) I doe from my heart renounce all Popery, and will die a member of the Reformed Church, wherein I was brought vp. Whereupon the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> perſwaded him to recant thoſe words, and to call to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> for helpe: but he would not, ſaying that he was ſory for that which he had already done. And within a while he kneeled downe againe, and the Executioner after that he had tyed a hand-kerchiefe ouer his eyes, with a ſword ſtrucke off his head; whereupon the Proteſtant women and children made ſuch a lamentable crie, that it made ſome of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelues weepe, and pull their hats ouer their eyes.</p>
               <p>This being done, they preſented to the view of all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders another pitifull ſpectacle, more lamentable than the former: A poore old man of about threeſcore and ten yeares of age, whoſe name was
<hi>Iohn Balkbern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r,</hi> who being not able to go, by reaſon of his long impriſonment, which was aboue two yeares in a Dungeon (as I was told) where none of his friends was permitted to viſit him, or to adminiſter any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto him, hauing beene racked and tortured three ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times: This man had beene one of the
<hi>Burghemaſters</hi> of the Towne, and euer oppoſed himſelfe againſt the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faction, in the defence of the Liberties of the Citie. Him they brought (ſupported by the Hangman and his man) to the ſcaffold, accompanied likewiſe with two
<hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,</hi> 
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:14140:63"/> and when he was got vp the ſcaffold, all the drums in the Citie were beaten, and the Trumpetters did found their Trumpets being ſet all round about the ſcaffold; becauſe that no man ſhould heare what this poore dying-man ſaid: who lifting vp his hands and eyes often towards heauen, in the end kneeled downe, and receiued very patiently that fatall ſtroke, the Executioner ſmiting off his head, as he had done the former. Whereupon the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> women and children made ſuch a great cry as they had formerly done, which made many of the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> yea the Gouernour himſelfe (who was a <hi>Germane</hi>) to weepe and ſhake his head. The Magiſtrates of the City, and the Emperours
<hi>Delegats</hi> ſate in a gallery on the ſide of the
<hi>State-houſe,</hi> to ſee the execution; which being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they withdrew themſelues backe into the <hi>State-houſe,</hi> where was a great feaſt prouided for them. Good God how merry were the <hi>Ieſuits, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> all that afternoone; I proteſt to you, I did ſee with mine eyes aboue twentie of them croſſing the ſtreets ſo drunke, that they could ſcarce go or ſtand, and when they met the Hangman they ſhooke him by the hand, as though he had beene ſome great <hi>Dutch Heer,</hi> or Lord, telling him that he had performed his part wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full well, which made the Rogue ſo proud of his office, that I heard him wiſh, that all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had but one head, and he the ſtriking of it off: vnto whom a townſman that was a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi> anſwered, ſaying, that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had but one head, which was
<hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> their <hi>Sauiour,</hi> vnto whom (ſaid he) thou baſe Varlet, ſhalt one day giue an account for thine vncharitable wiſh; and they that ſet thee on worke this day, for ſpilling of innocent bloud. Whereupon ſome <hi>Prieſts</hi> that ſtood by, and heard his words, went preſently to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and accuſed him, and preſently cauſed him to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and put in priſon; what became of him I know not, but I haue heard that he was baniſhed, and that he liueth now in <hi>Emden.</hi> Since that time the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> haue cauſed a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of free-ſtones to be erected in that place where the ſcaffold was, with the portraiture of the Hangman ſtriking off this mans head, with this inſcription in great capitall letters, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>They procured the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> (without any right or reaſon) to ſend <hi>Spinola</hi> with an army to take <hi>Weeſell,</hi> one of the <hi>Hans</hi> Cities, being at peace and amity with him, and little fearing any ſuch perfidious treachery, where they haue and ſtill doe vſe ſuch tyranny, that it is as good for the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to be vnder the

This noble City, wherein the Goſpell of Chriſt was truly and ſincerely preach'd, is now become a ſtinking Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and a prey to
<hi>Ieſuits</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were not content to make hauock of almoſt all they had, contrary to the compoſition made betweene
<hi>Spinola</hi> and them, when they yeelded the Towne vnto him, but alſo rauiſhed their wiues and daughters before their eyes, neither will they ſuffer them to make ſale of their houſes, and carry away that little they haue left them, and to permit them to depart to ſome other Country or City to ſeek their fortune; but compell them to ſtay there, &amp; to labour and toile (like ſo many ſlaues) to maintaine them. They haue the beſt Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Beds in their houſes, and they themſelues are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to lie vpon Mats and in ſtraw: they haue all their houſhold ſtuffe at their command, and they themſelues are compelled to waſh, ſcoure, and doe all manner of drudgery <pb n="118" facs="tcp:14140:64"/> for them. The poore Inhabitants muſt of neceſſity prouide Fiting, Candles, Salt, Vinegar, and Water for them <hi>gratis,</hi> and attend on them with cap and knee, or elſe be ſtab'd or well beaten.

               <p>In the yeere 1619. (comming from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> to
<hi>Holland</hi>) I came to this City, and arriuing at my lodging, where I was very well acquainted; the good man and his wife, who knew me, fell a weeping, telling me they had neuer a bed to lodge me in, for we haue ſix Spaniards (ſaid they) that lodge here, and the reſt of our beds they ſold and purloined away; and then they ſhewed me their houſe, and how they had ſold all their houſhold ſtuffe; for they had neither Braſſe, nor Pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor any thing to dreſſe their meat but one iron pot, for the reſt were earthen: they lay themſelues vpon a ſtraw bed, more like Beggars than Citizens. The day was farre ſpent, and I weary, that I could goe no further, and therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to ſtay there that night, and to lie vpon a boord or a bench. While I was comforting of the old folkes as well as I could, there came in a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldier that had loſt his money at Dice and Cards in the court of guard, and would haue borrowed a Dollar of the good wife, who told him that ſhe had none for her ſelfe; beſides (ſaid ſhe) you owe me ten Gilders (that is twenty ſhillings in Engliſh mony) I thought you would haue paid me that firſt, for I was conſtrained to pawne my bed to get money for you, and euer ſince my husband and I haue laine vpon ſtraw, which we neuer did before in all our life time; whereupon the Spaniard, <hi>Señor Iuan de Nauarra</hi> (for ſo was his name) called her <hi>Puta Vieja,</hi> old Whore, and a thouſand ſuch names, and ſhooke her almoſt all to peeces; then, leauing her crying, tooke the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14140:64"/> pottage pot and filled it halfe full with water, and put a great Brick-bat and a peece of rotten Cabbidge into it and laid it ouer the fire, and went out into the yard and brought in three or foure great Fagots and other wood, and made ſuch a great fire, that I was afraid he would haue burn'd the houſe; and thus he continued burning of Fagots and Billets (which are very deare there) for the ſpace of two houres, and would haue burnt more, had not ſhe gone forth and borrowed of one of the neighbours two ſhillings to giue him, for feare that he would haue burn'd all her wood; albeit, I thinke in my conſcience that he did burne in that time more than did coſt her eight pence. But when he had the money, away he went, and then ſhe tooke off the pot, and threw the ſtone and rotten Cabbidge away, and made ſomething ready for our Supper; but before that we could make an end, two other Spaniards came in, and without bidding or inuiting, ſate downe with vs and tooke part of that little we had, and then went away without offering any money, or ſaying ſo much as we thanke you.</p>
               <p>The very ſame night, another Spaniard would haue the old woman after ten of the clocke to goe and fetch him a whore; and becauſe ſhe would not goe, hee gaue her three or foure blowes with his Musket reſt, and would haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her bones if another whore of his acquaintance had not come in (hearing the old woman cry) who pacified him, and lay with <hi>Señor Laurencio</hi> (for ſo was his name) that night. O the Religion and conſcience of theſe Catholike Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, that tyrannize farre worſe than the <hi>Turke,</hi> whereſoeuer they get the vpper hand!</p>
               <p>But now to returne againe to the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> who are the only commanders of this City, whoſe words are Lawes, yea Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles among the Spaniards. They preach and catechiſe young children twiſe or thriſe a weeke, yea the Souldiers doe take proteſtants children by force, and bring them to the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> to be inſtructed in popery. Alas, if I ſhould tell you all the wrongs and miſdemeanours that the

<hi>Spaine;</hi> another in the ſame manner repreſenting the King of
<hi>France;</hi> others the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> (that is now Emperour) and all other Catholike Princes. Euery one of them hauing a guard of Souldiers both horſe and foot, all being the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> Schollers. They were all drawne out in their diuiſions Souldier-like, hauing their Captaines and other Officers (who were <hi>Ieſuites</hi>) to lead them on, in a great market place which is by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church: from whence the counterfeit hearſe was brought forth, carried and accompanied with many Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with that ſtate and Ceremonies as great Princes are wont to be brought to their laſt home. After that followed theſe Kings and Princes ſeuerally accompanied with their traine and guard, hauing their banners carried before each of them placed by Heralds. Then came the <hi>Breaden god,</hi> their Sacrament, carried by a <hi>Ieſuit</hi> vnder a Canopie, borne by foure ſchollers in white Surplices ſinging: after that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Image of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> very curiouſly wrought (wherein wanted neitheir coſt nor art) carried vpon mens ſhoulders accompanied with many
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men: and laſt of all came <hi>Wickliffe, Iohn Hus, Ierome</hi> of <hi>Pragus, Martin Luther, Caluin, Beza, M. Bucer, P. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Oecolampadius, Zuinglius, Bullinger, Melancton, Fox,</hi> and Maſter
<hi>Perkins,</hi> all bound with iron chaines, and led and guarded with a ſquadron of Deuils: who made the <hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> and other Clergy men to skip for ioy, to ſee thoſe men that had writ en againſt them to be led captiue by <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> and his Angels. The Hearſe being thus attended by ſo many Kings and Princes, the Sacrament, the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and the blacke guard marcht forward to the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> College, where they all entered and fell to their prayers: <pb n="121" facs="tcp:14140:65"/> here might you haue ſeene <hi>Hus, Luther, Beza, Perkins,</hi> and the reſt; yea, the Deuils with their Beads in their hands ſay <hi>Paters</hi> and <hi>Aues</hi> for the Emperours ſoule.

               <p>All theſe Souldiers were the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> Schollers, and taught and inſtructed in military Diſcipline by the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, who are euery where martiall men, and giuen <hi>tam Martiquàm Mercurio:</hi> for in euery Army, Leaguer, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, or Nauie that any Catholike King or Prince hath, there the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> will be as buſie as an Atturney in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> Hall in the middeſt of a tearme. <hi>Hij Palladi oratores, noui Philoſophi, in Caſtris non in Clauſtris verſantur.</hi> They had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſtirring abroad and follow the Campe, than bee confined within the circuit of a Cloiſter. And therein they doe imitate their Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> of infamous memory, for he was a Souldier, and ſo are they: yea, in euery one of their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges they haue Armour and munition to furniſh many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souldiers; and beſides, there is not any one of them but knowes how to vſe his Armes, as if he had beene a Souldier all the daies of his life. To conclude, this funerall or Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies did coſt the Parents and friends of theſe young Ieſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Kings and Princes (by report) aboue two thouſand pounds ſterling.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay? The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> haue beene the vtter ruine and ouerthrow of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> the laſt King of
<hi>Portugall</hi> and <hi>Algarbes;</hi> for through their policie and wicked counſell he loſt his Crownes and Kingdomes, and in the end his life.</p>
               <p>They haue beene the chiefeſt cauſe of all the ciuill Warres, Maſſacres, and troubles in <hi>France,</hi> ſince the death of
<hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> to this preſent time.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeditious infernall Locuſts haue beene the only oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion <pb n="122" facs="tcp:14140:66"/> of thoſe bloudy warres betweene the King of
<hi>Poland</hi> and the great Duke of <hi>Moſcouia</hi> or
<hi>Ruſſia;</hi> and againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Poland</hi> and
<hi>Swethland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Haue not the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> beene the cauſe of the loſſe of <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talin,</hi> the vpper and lower <hi>Palatinate?</hi> And haue they not beene the cauſe of all theſe Wars, Bloudſhed, Commotions, Dearth, Famine, Perſecutions, Rapine, Miſeries, Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Deſtructions that haue hapned in <hi>Italy, France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Bohemia, Netherlands,</hi> the ſeuenteene <hi>Prouinces,</hi> and other neighbouring Countries, Cities, Townes, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths, theſe forty or fifty yeeres and vpwards?</p>
               <p>I omit to ſpeake of their ſeuerall trecherous deſignes againſt Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory, or of the
<hi>Gunpowder</hi> treaſon, or how that they haue beene theſe twenty yeeres baniſhed out of all the territories of the <hi>Signory</hi> of
<hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> for their impoſtures and lewd practiſes, and for being common diſturbers of the peace and tranquillity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. Neither how they haue incroached vpon the priuileges and liberties of moſt of the famous Schooles and Vniuerſities of <hi>Italy, Spaine, Portugall, France, Netherland, Germany, Poland,</hi> and other Catholike Countries. But I will ſpeake a word or two more of their Colleges, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Schooles, and manner or method of teaching, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, I would haue you to vnderſtand that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue none into their Society, but ſuch as are either deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of great parentage and good friends, whoſe greatneſſe may countenance their deſignes, and procure others to bee beneficiall vnto them; or ſuch as are wealthy, to inrich their Colleges; or learned and witty Schollers, who by their workes &amp; writings, are like to aduance the credit and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſociety; or ſome Tradeſ-men to be their Lay-bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Officers of their Colleges; or elſe ſome cunning fly knaue or crafty companion to bee their <hi>Porter,</hi> vpon whoſe truth and fidelity they may aſſuredly rely and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend: for the <hi>Porter</hi> muſt be a ſmooth tongu'd fellow, and as true as ſteele, or elſe he is not for their turne; neither will they put him into that office, before ſuch time as they haue <pb n="123" facs="tcp:14140:66"/> had a long triall and experience of his wit and fidelity; for he knowes more of their knauery than all the reſt of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, except it be the
<hi>Rector</hi> and two or three more: beſides, what gift or meſſage ſoeuer is ſent vnto any of the College, it muſt come firſt to his hands; for the College gate is alwaies locked faſt, and he hath the key tied to his girdle.</p>
               <p>Euery <hi>Ieſuite</hi> in their Colleges hath ſome imployment or office; as for example, ſome are imployed in writing books of controuerſies, or otherwiſe; whoſe workes neuer come to the Preſſe till the father <hi>Prouinciall,</hi> and the beſt Diuines, and the beſt learned men of their ſociety of that <hi>Prouince,</hi> yea of the next
<hi>Prouince,</hi> and moſt commonly their <hi>Generall</hi> (who liues alwaies at <hi>Rome</hi>) doe peruſe, correct, and amend the ſame; ſo that they neuer print any booke in any of their names, without the mature counſell and aduice of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours. Which (in my opinion) would not doe amiſſe, if the Diuines of the reformed Church would doe the like among themſelues.</p>
               <p>Some of them that haue the gift of preaching, doe ſtudy their Sermons, the Fathers, and Schoole Diuinity, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to heare Confeſſions and ſay Maſſes, albeit all thoſe that are Prieſts are Maſſe-mongers: others doe trot here and there abroad about the College affaires: and others, who are Lay-brethren, haue imploiments enough either at home or abroad; for ſome of them are Tailors, and are euer making of new Habits, or elſe mending of old for the other Fathers and Lay-brethren. They haue Phyſicians, Apothecaries, Chirurgians, Barbers, Printers, Tailors, Shoomakers, Cookes, Waſhers, Bakers and Brewers (if they liue in a beere Country) of their owne order and ſociety. And ſo haue all (or the moſt part) of the other Orders of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> in all popiſh Countries, eſpecially in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and therefore poore Tradeſ-men get little or nothing by the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> or any other <hi>Monks, Friers</hi> or <hi>Nuns</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>The younger ſort of them doe teach children the Latine and the Greeke tongues (except it be in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where neuer or ſeldome the Greek is taught in the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> Schools, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14140:67"/> except it be in ſome Vniuerſities.) And they diuide their Shools into fiue Claſſes, that is to ſay, in the firſt the
<hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence,</hi> or Introduction to the eight parts of ſpeech, and the declination of Nounes and Verbes, which they call <hi>Figures:</hi> the ſecond, the <hi>Grammar:</hi> the third, the <hi>Syntax:</hi> the fourth,
<hi>Poetry:</hi> the fifth, <hi>Rhetoricke.</hi> But if it be in an Vniuerſity, then they haue other Claſſes and Lectorers, for <hi>Logick, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, Diuinity,</hi> and all the other Arts. Now in euery Claſſe there is a <hi>Ieſuite</hi> that teacheth. The Schollers doe remoue or proceed once euery yeere (which is after their vacation, about
<hi>Michaelmas</hi>) from one Claſſe to another, for they are ordinarily no longer than one yeere in one Claſſe. And euery Schoole-maſter is appointed by the <hi>Prefect</hi> of the Schooles, how much he muſt reade and expound vnto his Schollers euery day; for he muſt giue them no more, nor no leſſe than the ordinary Leſſon. And withall, hee teacheth Greeke Grammar, and other Greeke Authors, together with the Latine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> doe euery other yeere extract out of ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors as they like beſt, as well Latine as Greeke, ſuch ſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted places as is moſt commodious and fitting to reade to young youths, and doe print the ſame in their owne Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and ſell them at a very deare rate to their Schollers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing to euery Claſſe ſuch other bookes, beſides the Grammar, as is fit for their tender capacity. Their Grammar, and all the reſt of their ſchoole bookes are of the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> owne collections. They teach ſtill the ſelfe ſame Grammar in all their Schooles, in what Country ſoeuer they be; but in the other bookes, whether they be in proſe or verſe, they differ, and euery ſecond yeere they alter all their ſchoole bookes, except the <hi>Figures, Grammar,</hi> and <hi>Syntax,</hi> of meere policy to vtter the more bookes, and conſequently to gaine the more money, for they haue very many Schollers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe not permit any Latine Schoole beſides their owne in any towne or City where they reſide.</p>
               <p>In the three lower Claſſes they appoint two ſeuerall
<hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,</hi> the one they call the <hi>Emperour</hi> of the Eaſt, the other of the Weſt, as it was heretofore in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14140:67"/> 
                  <hi>Great,</hi> and others, when the Empire of
<hi>Rome</hi> was diuided into two parts betweene two <hi>Emperours,</hi> whereof the one was called the <hi>Emperour</hi> of the Eaſt, &amp; kept his Court at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi> and the other the <hi>Emperour</hi> of the Weſt, who commonly now adaies reſides at <hi>Prague</hi> in
<hi>Bohemia.</hi> Now the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> that are the Schoole-maſters, doe diuide their Schollers in euery Claſſe equally betweene theſe two
<hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> appointing vnto euery one his owne ſubiects, who are likewiſe diuided into ſeuerall offices or callings, as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, Senators, Patricians, Knights, Plebeyans,</hi> and the like. Theſe
<hi>Emperours</hi> (who moſt commonly are ſome great mens ſonnes) doe ſit Maieſtically in very faire Chaires or Stats, hauing their Scutchions, Banners, and <hi>Mottos</hi> drawne out very curiouſly, at the end of a lance, faſtened to the wall ouer their heads. And the <hi>Conſuls, Senators,</hi> and the reſt of the chiefeſt men doe ſit according to their dignities, places, and offices, euery one hauing his Scutchion ouer the place where he ſits.</p>
               <p>In euery Claſſe the Schoole-maſter doth appoint eight or ten (and ſometimes more or leſſe, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Students) Schollers whom they thinke fit, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary pregnancie of wit and learning, to be <hi>Prefects</hi> ouer the other Schollers who beare no dignity or office in that Claſſe, and to heare them recite their Leſſons, and to giue vp the names of ſuch as are not perfect therin to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who inioynes them to ſome publike or priuate penance, as to ſweepe the Schoole, to ſtand vpon his feet for a certaine time in the Schoole, to ſay ſo many <hi>Paſter Noſter,</hi> or <hi>Aue Maria</hi> vpon their knees, in the open ſtreet before their Church doore, to copie out of ſome booke ſo many lines or pages, and the like penance; for they whip them neuer publikely in the Schoole, but ſend them to the Father
<hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> who giues them correction priuately in a little roome which is by the Schoole for that purpoſe; for the boies had rather vndergoe priuate correction than a publike penance; becauſe thoſe that paſſe by will laugh and huſh at them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they either correct them or impoſe any publike pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance vpon any, vnleſſe he be a meere block-head, that will
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14140:68"/> not learne, or one that hath committed ſome extrordinary offence or crime.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the <hi>Porter</hi> at the time appointed that they ſhould come to the Schooles, rings a bell, and at the very laſt toll all the Schoole-maſters come out together, and goe euery man to his owne Claſſe, and there ſtay till the bell rings againe; and then againe at the firſt toll, they and the Schollers come out, for they muſt not breake the Orders and Rules of the Schoole.</p>
               <p>In the morning, after they haue been at Schoole an houre and a halfe or thereabout, the ſame bell rings, and then they goe to Church to heare Maſſe, which endures halfe an houre, and then they returne to their Claſſes againe. But in ſome Countries (when the daies are long) after Maſſe they goe home to breake-faſt, and within halfe an houre after they come to ſchoole againe. Euery day (or euery other day) they haue diſputations in the three lowermoſt Claſſes, where the boies doe challenge and prouoke one another in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of <hi>Nounes, Pronounes, Verbs,</hi> or <hi>Participles,</hi> or in coniugating of <hi>Verbs</hi> either in Latine or Greeke. And this they doe for to get one anothers place, which breeds ſuch emulations among them, that it makes them of their owne accord ſtudy both night and day, ſome to maintaine their places, ſeats and dignities; and others of meere ſchoole am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, to aſpire and aſcend higher. But none muſt (as I haue heard) challenge or prouoke the Emperour, or the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, but thoſe that are next in dignity vnto them, ſo that thoſe of the <hi>Plebeyans</hi> cannot aſcend to the <hi>Senate,</hi> or any other place or dignity but by degree.</p>
               <p>When two of them haue done diſputing, the Maſter giues his iudgement, and then other boies ſtart vp, and craue leaue of the Maſter to challenge their aduerſary to the combat, who permits thoſe two (whom he pleaſeth) to enter into the Liſt; and thereupon theſe two companions ſtand vp and croſſe themſelues firſt, before they beginne to oppoſe one another.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ieſuits</hi> haue another pretty tricke how to make their Schollers ſtudy, and bring in profit for themſelues: that is,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14140:68"/> They will ſometimes giue vnto their Schollers both a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate or a publike <hi>Premium,</hi> a reward, which doth not onely animate and incourage the boies to ſtudy, but alſo oblige and enduce their parents to recompence the Schoole-maſter. But vnto great men, or rich mens ſonnes, they doe vſe to giue the beſt <hi>Premia,</hi> or rewards, becauſe they doe expect in counter-exchange a great recompence: to the poorer ſort they giue little Pictures of Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> their Patron, of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or of ſome Saint that they moſt affect. But on the richer ſort they beſtow Beads and Bookes, or ſome coſtlier Pictures.</p>
               <p>Euery Saturday in the afternoone, all the Schollers of their ſeuerall Claſſes doe meet together in a great ſpacious roome, to be catechized by one of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> who is appointed to expound
<hi>Caniſius</hi> Catechiſme, and to ſtrike or infuſe into their tender capacitie ſuch damnable points of doctrine as they pleaſe; as, that it is a meritorious deed to murder Kings and Princes, being excommunicated by the Pope. To equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate, cog, lye, cheat, and that a Roman Catholike is not bound, or tied to keepe faith with Heretikes, meaning <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi> And a thouſand more of their Ieſuiticall poſitions, which I for breuitie ſake doe forbeare to treat of. Into this catechizing Schoole none are permitted to enter but onely their owne Schollers, for it ſeemes they are aſhamed to let men of vnderſtanding know what good inſtructions they giue vnto their Pupils. But howſoeuer, thoſe points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they ſtrike into their capacity in their tender age, the ſame very ſeldome weareth away, but rather increaſeth with their yeeres, as daily experience teacheth vs.</p>
               <p>I would to God that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the true Orthodoxall Religion, would be as carefull to haue her children inſtructed in their nonage, in the truth of the Goſpell of our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> which leadeth them to ſaluation; as that falſe Mountebanke Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Chaire of
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the ſonne of <hi>perdition</hi> doth, to hurle them headlong to hell and damnation. And therefore I would wiſh all religious and painfull Schoole-maſters to take a courſe, that thoſe Infants which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <pb n="128" facs="tcp:14140:69"/> to their tutelage bee (before all things) well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and taught the Chriſtian Doctrine, and the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or grounds of the true Religion.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> Schollers muſt not reueale vnto any man thoſe points of Doctrine that are taught them in their catechizing Schooles; for if they doe, they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it to their ghoſtly Father (who is a <hi>Ieſuite</hi>) and moſt commonly the
<hi>Prefect</hi> of the Schooles, when he comes to be ſhrift, which is once euery moneth, and then he is ſure to haue ſome extraordinary penance inflicted vpon him, and euer after to be branded and noted for a
<hi>Tell-tale</hi> out of the Schooles. But ſuch as will ſwallow downe this golden poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned bait, and proue a good Proficient, oh he is a good boy, and ſhall not want his <hi>Premium;</hi> for indeed this day is the ordinary time, that they beſtow their beſt <hi>Premia,</hi> or Rewards vpon their Schollers. Oh the ſubtilties and trumperies of theſe <hi>Loyoliſts,</hi> to ſeduce theſe ſimple youths to their diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall and Antichriſtian doctrine.</p>
               <p>And whereas they take vpon them to inſtruct and teach children freely, and without any reward; I dare boldly ſpeake it, they get ſix times more than if they would keepe a mercenary Schoole, for it is but a poore Schoole that brings them not in yeerely aboue fiue or ſix hundred pound ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. But their Schooles in great Cities and Vniuerſities are worth a great deale more, for it is an ordinary thing to ſee ſeuen or eight hundred Schollers in their fiue inferiour Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and therefore in thoſe Colleges where they teach all the Arts, and where there are twelue Claſſes, and euery Claſſe a Maſter, there are not moſt commonly leſſe than a thouſand or fifteene hundred Schollers, who are ſtill ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their parents and friends to be bountifull to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the
<hi>Ieſuites:</hi> and they themſelues, when they come to inherit their Lands, Patrimony, or Portions, will likely be beneficiall to them, and ſtill fauour and protect their ſociety and faction to the vttermoſt of their power. Yea, the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of them all, that are not able to beſtow any gratuity vpon them when they are young and their Schollers, when they are come to age and preferment, will not be vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <pb n="129" facs="tcp:14140:69"/> to them of whom they had their learning and education.</p>
               <p>And againe, the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> doe ſpeake to their Schollers, whoſe Parents are rich (if they dwell in the ſame Towne or City) to perſwade them to frequent their Churches to heare Maſſes, and to come to them to Confeſſion, and withall to be of their ſodality, to the end they might the better diue into their ſecrets, and participate of their wealth, which is the maine matter they aime at.</p>
               <p>And whereas all other <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Nuns</hi> make three Vowes, that is to ſay, <hi>Chaſtity, Pouerty,</hi> and
<hi>Obedience;</hi> the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> (to the end to giue a puſh beyond all other religious Orders) adde one more; which is, that they ſhall at all times be ready to runne and trudge from one Country to another, like poore Rogues, to what part ſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe the holy Father the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and their Father <hi>Generall</hi> to ſend them; yea though it were to the worlds end, and murder Kings and Princes to merit Heauen. And withall, all other <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> doe make theſe three Vowes but once, which is after that they haue beene in the Habit one whole yeere, which they call the yeere of <hi>approbation</hi> or
<hi>nouiceſhip,</hi> at which time they make their profeſſion; yet the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> will haue their <hi>Nouices</hi> to ſerue them two yeeres in their <hi>nouiciat</hi> before they make their Vowes; which firſt Vowes they call <hi>Vota ſimplicia,</hi> ſingle Vowes, becauſe they can (as they ſay) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with them: for after a man hath beene a
<hi>Ieſuit</hi> twenty or thirty yeeres, they may (if they pleaſe) put him away and exclude him out of their ſociety; whereof I haue knowne many, yea among our Engliſh <hi>Ieſuites</hi> I haue knowne ſome, namely one who went by the name of Maſter <hi>Floyd,</hi> who liued at <hi>Paris</hi> not long agoe, and is now but a <hi>Secular Prieſt,</hi> albeit he was for many yeeres a <hi>Ieſuite;</hi> the reaſon is (as I thinke) becauſe he, and thoſe that they put out of their ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, were not wicked enough to keepe them company: or elſe doe put themſelues out of the ſociety of the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> when they perceiue their villany.</p>
               <p>But when one hath beene trained vp many yeeres in their
<hi>Machauillian</hi> Schoole, if he be for their turne, then he makes thoſe Vowes again, and then he is a profeſſed <hi>Iudaiſt,</hi> which is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14140:70"/> not without a long proofe and triall of his integrity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion to their Order, and to the rearing vp of the Spaniſh
<hi>Monarchie;</hi> and then, and not before, they will acquaint him with the hidden myſteries of their Order. For in ſome Colleges there are threeſcore or foureſcore <hi>Ieſuites;</hi> and yet not aboue three or foure profeſſed <hi>Ieſuites;</hi> yea albeit they weare all one kinde of Habite, and fare all alike. And in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Cities they haue three Houſes: Firſt their <hi>Domus Profeſſa,</hi> wherein liue none but profeſſed
<hi>Ieſuites:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>their College,</hi> where they haue their Schooles, wherein the <hi>Rector,</hi> and one or two more of them are Profeſſed, and none elſe: And laſtly, their <hi>Nouiciate,</hi> where all their young <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices</hi> are kept, and mewed vp, vnder the gouernment of a <hi>Rector,</hi> and two or three more profeſſed
<hi>Machiauills.</hi>

            <p>HAuing treated of all <hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> and

            <p>Theſe Iuglers haue many wayes and trickes to cheat men of their money, beſides that which they get by begging, as by ſale of their priuate Maſſes, Confeſſions, lying Miracles, Pardons and Indulgences, Reliques, Confraternities, and the like. And withall, by perſwading other men that are rich, to become <hi>Friers</hi> of their Orders; and ſometimes they doe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce young Merchants and ſhop-keepers, to breake with their Creditors, and vnder-hand to purloine and ſell away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens goods, and to offer or giue them all the money, which they haue, or can borrow, and then they will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them into their Orders; and perhaps ſend them away priuately vnto ſome other Monaſtery of their Order in ſome other Prouince, to be taught and inſtructed in their Rule and diſcipline, for one whole yeare, which they call the yeare of <hi>Approbation</hi> or <hi>Nouice-ſhip:</hi> for after that one hath beene a yeare in any Cloiſter either of <hi>Monks</hi> or
<hi>Friers,</hi> (the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> only excepted, who haue two yeares of
<hi>Approbation</hi>) if he be willing to perſeuere, and to leade a Monaſticall life, he makes his profeſſion and thoſe three Vowes, of
<hi>Chaſtitie, Pouertie,</hi> and <hi>Obedience:</hi> but how well they performe and keepe theſe Vowes, God, and all thoſe that are well acquainted with their Iuglings, doe know full well. Now, if a man enter into any Order of
<hi>Monks</hi> or <hi>Friers,</hi> no man dare trouble him, for all his debts are payed, though he owed ten millions; for then he is a holy man, though neuer ſo wicked a knaue before; and to arreſt him, is no leſſe offence than ſacrilege. Now let vs ſpeake a word of all theſe in order.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, theſe <hi>Monks, Friers, Ieſuites</hi> and
<hi>Prieſts,</hi> doe get a world of money by their Maſſes: for they haue men that ſit all day long, in ſome place in their Churches, (eſpecially in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>) with a great paper-booke, like a ſhop-book, vpon a table, to write downe the names of all ſuch that bring money, to haue Maſſes ſaid, and how many Maſſes they would haue ſaid, and wherefore; whether for the liuing, or for the dead, or for their good ſucceſſe in their iourney, or to <pb n="133" facs="tcp:14140:71"/> obtaine their deſire againſt their enemies, or for their good intents; or for their friends, either liuing, or for their ſoules in <hi>Purgatory:</hi> or for their health; or for their cattell, heards or flockes; or for the
<hi>Popes</hi> Holineſſe, and the extirpation of the Goſpell, (which they call Hereſie) and the exaltation of their Catholike Religion: or for a woman that is great with childe, that ſhe may haue a ſpeedie deliuerance; and ſometimes that the childe may proue to be a boy; and a thouſand ſuch matters: for they will ſay Maſſe (or at leaſt-wiſe they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to doe it) for any thing, if you will giue them money. If your head doe ake, or if you haue paine in your teeth, or in your belly, or if one be in danger to loſe his eye-ſight, or his hearing; or if you are troubled with the cholike, the gowt, the dropſey, or the <hi>French</hi> P. or the like: bring <hi>Monks, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Ieſuits,</hi> or any other <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> money, and they will mumble a Maſſe for you: nay they will doe you more good (as they ſay) than all the Doctors of Phyſicke, Montebancks or Chirurgeans in the world can performe. The price of the Maſſe is ſet downe by the <hi>Popes</hi> holineſſe. In
<hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> it is two ſhillings, in <hi>France</hi> a ſhilling, in the <hi>Low Countries, Germany</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> eight pence or nine pence, and in ſome poore Countries ſix pence; for the
<hi>Proteſtant Miniſters</hi> haue ſpoiled their market. In
<hi>England</hi> now adayes, the ordinary price is a ſhilling, neuertheleſſe none, or few at all, will offer them ſo little; becauſe that our <hi>Monks, Friers, Ieſuites,</hi> and other <hi>Popiſh Prieſts,</hi> are in more danger than thoſe forraigne Clergie men; and withall haue no other maintenance, but their Maſſe and breaden god (vnleſſe it be ſuch as are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by noble and rich perſonages) and therfore they do vſe to giue them <hi>a peece,</hi> or <hi>halfe a peece,</hi> to ſay as many Maſſes for them as they pleaſe. And indeed our <hi>Engliſh collapſed Ladies,</hi> and others of their ſex are more bountifull vnto theſe holy men, for they giue theſe buſie hornets, ten or twenty pounds at a clap, to ſay a <hi>Trentall</hi> or two of Maſſes for them, and for their friends that are in <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it is worth the obſeruations, vpon what ſleight pretence they ground the neceſſitie of <hi>Auricular Confeſſion,</hi> deceiuing the ignorant people, with their ſmooth and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14140:72"/> impoſtures, wherein (they ſay) the <hi>Prieſt cannot remit ſinnes, vnleſſe men will confeſſe them vnto him.</hi> Then which <hi>Propoſition</hi> nothing can bee more falſe; for the
<hi>Prieſt</hi> may <hi>preach,</hi> and <hi>publiſh Remiſſion,</hi> or
<hi>Retention</hi> of <hi>ſinnes</hi> to thoſe, whoſe faults he knowes not; and thoſe men by a faithfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of what they heare, may receiue the <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of their ſins, who neuer reuealed them to the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> but confeſſed them vnto God alone:

            <p>And it is moſt certaine, that manifold abſurdities and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are committed vnder the colour of <hi>Auricular Confeſſion:</hi> It being a thing which the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without any warrant of Gods Word, and quite contrary to the practiſe of the <hi>Primitiue Church,</hi> hath taken vp at her owne hand.

O, all their care and chiefeſt ſtudy is to deſcribe this famous Country vnto the common people. Verily, I thinke there is neuer a
<hi>Geographer</hi> (be he neuer ſo learned) that can ſo well paint and deſcribe the earth, with all the parts thereof, as theſe
<hi>Mountebanks</hi> (I meane <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers,</hi> and popiſh Clergy men) doe draw out theſe infernall Regions, and thoſe Low Countries; but I wonder whether they ſpeake by heare ſay, or that they haue beene there in proper perſon, for they can tell of euery little creeke or corner. Howbeit we ſee that the beſt <hi>Coſmographers</hi> doe faile oft times in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the earth, and of many Countries and Regions which are moſt familiar and beſt knowne vnto vs. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, there is not almoſt a Country better knowne than <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> neuertheleſſe we often times ſee great errors in thoſe Cards in which they are deſcribed. And therefore we may coniecture that it may ſo chance in other Tables, Maps, or Cards containing the deſcription of the Heauen, Earth, and many other Countries vnknowne. But <hi>Monks</hi> and
<hi>Friers</hi> haue the ſpirit to compoſe and make a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Map of theſe low infernall Regions, yea better than the Painters haue painted them out in their Churches, or the Printers in the Shepherds Callender. And therefore I would aduiſe all that intend to trauell into the Kingdome of
<hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> to take a <hi>Monk,</hi> a <hi>Frier,</hi> or a popiſh
<hi>Prieſt</hi> for their guide; as <hi>Circes</hi> guided

            <p>But would you know who was the firſt that found out
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14140:75"/> this hot Region or Kingdome of <hi>Purgatory?</hi> haue but pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and I will tell you. Mine Author is <hi>Peter</hi> of
<hi>Amiens,</hi> who wrote in a booke of this diſcouery, in the time of Pope
<hi>Iohn</hi> the eight, 1000. yeeres after the paſſion of our Sauiour
<hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that one <hi>Odillus</hi> Abbot of the
<hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Cluny,</hi> being in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and hearing oftentimes the noiſe, cries, and bewailings which were made continually about the hill <hi>Aetna</hi> (which now is called in the Italian tongue <hi>Gibello monte</hi>) did imagine that it came from the Deuils; lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the ſoules of the faithfull deceaſed were deliuered from torments through the
<hi>Maſſes, Vigiles, Prayers, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> and <hi>Offerings</hi> of the liuing Chriſtians; he preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the ſame to his
<hi>Monks,</hi> and they all decreed together, that after they had offered their <hi>Offerings</hi> the firſt day of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember,</hi> and celebrated the Feaſts of <hi>All Saints</hi> in their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, they would in like manner the next day make prayers and ſupplications for the ſoules of all the faithfull deceaſed. And afterwards, in ſucceſſion of time, others receiued and allowed that manner of doing as good and holy. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was (as I thinke) becauſe the Poets and the fooliſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people imagined that there was a place there to deſcend into hell, and the place in which the ſoules of the wicked were tormented for their ſinnes; becauſe that in the ſame Mountaine there is a perpetuall fire which alwaies burneth, and hath done ſo of long time, wherefore they thought that the damned were kept in thoſe burning Gulfes. By this meanes, <hi>Odillus</hi> and his <hi>Monks</hi> were the Authors that the Papiſts did and ſtill doe celebrate Feaſts and offer Sacrifices for the dead in the moneth of <hi>Nouember,</hi> as the old Roman Pagans did heretofore in the moneth of <hi>February,</hi> by the inſtitution of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the ſecond King of the Romans.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>But this was at the firſt but an imagination of
<hi>Odillus,</hi> yet afterwards it brought no little profit to his Couent, and to all <hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts;</hi> for the ſecond day of
<hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember</hi> is the beſt <hi>Mart</hi> or Faire they haue in all the yeere, and a time in which they make harueſt and vintage all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without taking very much paines. And if the ſoules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14140:76"/> had as much gaine as they haue, they might be very ioyfull of that Feaſt, but all is but meere deceit and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenage of the
<hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> to gull the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people of their money. Others haue dreamed of the Mountaines of <hi>Iſland</hi> and
<hi>Norway,</hi> and of another hill there called <hi>Nadhegrime;</hi> yea, of another in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Patricks</hi> Purgatory, and therefore it ſeemes there is more Purgatories than one. But I thinke
<hi>Trophonius</hi> his Den or Caue in <hi>Lebaida</hi> hath ingendred Saint
<hi>Patricks</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory: for <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth maruellous things that <hi>Timar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> ſaw in the Caue of <hi>Trophonius,</hi> which doth differ but a little of that which the popiſh <hi>Prieſts</hi> doe relate of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.</p>
            <p>And truly, I thinke that they can bring no better proofe to maintaine their Purgatory, than out of the <hi>Shepherds Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar, Homer, Virgil, Ouid,</hi> or <hi>Dant.</hi> And withall, it may be they conferred with
<hi>Alceſtis, Proteſilaus, Hercules, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus, Vlyſſes,</hi> and
<hi>Aeneas,</hi> whom the Poets doe faine to haue beene in Hell, and thoſe infernall parts; as <hi>Limbus Patrum, Purgatory,</hi> and the <hi>Eliſian field:</hi> and therefore haue learned of them their Diuinity; or it may be demanded whether <hi>Lazarus</hi> told them any ſuch newes. For my part I thinke that cannot be, for there was neither <hi>Pope, Monk, Frier, Prieſt,</hi> or <hi>Purgatory</hi> for many hundred yeeres after their time. Neuertheleſſe, theſe <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> doe make
<hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> another <hi>Alceſtis, Theſeus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and
<hi>Aeneas,</hi> to declare vnto them what was done in hell and the reſt of thoſe low Regions. But as <hi>Pythagoras, Lucrecius,</hi> and
<hi>Lucianus</hi> ſcoff'd and mock'd at the inuentions of the Poets touching their Hell; ſo may any man laugh at their fooliſh fancies, and at the vaine credulity and frenſie of the fooliſh ignorant people, who giue credit vnto them: for there is nothing more vnconſtant, more fooliſh, more mutable, or more ready to beleeue all lies, fables, or follies, than the common people.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Coſmographers</hi> haue diuided the earth hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore into three parts, <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europe;</hi> euen ſo doe the popiſh <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> diuide the infernall Regions <pb n="143" facs="tcp:14140:76"/> into <hi>Limbus Patrum, Purgatorie,</hi> and the <hi>Hell</hi> of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and make them all inhabited and ſo full of poore ſoules, that there is not one little corner but is full, eſpecially <hi>Purgatory.</hi> But I thinke it is to be coniectured, that the walls of <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> and <hi>Purgatory,</hi> forged and built heretofore by the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> were battered downe and burnt by Doctor
<hi>Martin Luther,</hi> Maſter <hi>Iohn Caluin,</hi> and others, that there remaines now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Hell</hi> onely. But theſe
<hi>Mountebankes</hi> doe teach ſtill the contrary, and doe inſiſt that all children that are borne dead, and all thoſe that die without Baptiſme (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though borne of Chriſtian Parents) goe ſtraight into <hi>Limbus Infantium;</hi> where they haue placed them apart, ſeparated from
<hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Purgatory;</hi> and that they ſhall neuer come thence, or to participate of the ioyes of Heauen. Howbeit they commend nothing ſo much as <hi>Purgatory;</hi> for vnto the ſoules that goe thither, they giue Chambers apart, and keepe them as priſoners vntill they pay their ranſome. And is not this good Doctrine? Verily, I beleeue that theſe ſhauelings that maintaine <hi>Limbus</hi> and <hi>Purgatory,</hi> are inſpired with the ſame ſpirit that <hi>Plato, Plutark, Orpheus, Homer, Virgil,</hi> and
<hi>Ouid</hi> were, who haue ſo well deſcribed them, that it is not poſſible to paint or ſet them out better.</p>
            <p>To proue <hi>Limbus,</hi> giue eare to what the Poet ſaith, from whence likely the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> proue it as far as I think.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgil</hi> were more pittifull than the

And that they ſhould vomit and caſt vp againe great cruelties, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences, and great iniuries that they haue committed in this world, becauſe they neither feared God nor iudgement.

            <p>Againe, the Pope and his ſhauelings doe lodge the rich people, and great Princes and Lords in their <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and not in
<hi>Hell,</hi> if they be Catholikes forſooth. And therein they differ from
<hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> But would you know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe there could come no profit vnto <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> of

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14140:77"/> did not ſeduce the ignorant people to inrich themſelues: for they doe ſhew by their writings that they had a certaine feare and knowledge of God; and (in ſome ſort) more than the Pope and his Clergy; becauſe popiſh <hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> doe watch ouer their dead bodies as the Rauens doe vpon Carrion. And if they happen to meet with a dead man that hath his purſe well cram'd with money, wherewith he is able to pay his ranſome, they will be ſure to make him vnderſtand who hath eaten the fat: for they will put him into <hi>Purgatory,</hi> from whence he ſhall not come out before they haue taken ſome fat from him. Nay, theſe hangmen will not ſuffer the poore ſoules to be broiled and tormented of the Deuils, but they will be their Executioners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And therein they take from the Deuill that office that God gaue him. But I would aduiſe them to amend in time, leſt one day they themſelues bee tormented in hell by the Deuill and his angels.</p>

For we doe not finde it written in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that there ſhould be any Order of people ordained only to pray for others, and at their charges, and to be maintained and releeued by them, without doing any other thing; and to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14140:80"/> ſing, when others weepe, and withall to make merchandize of prayers. For this office to pray for himſelfe and for others, was giuen to all the Church, and principally to the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> whom our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> hath ordained, not onely to pray for the Church, and to leaue the preaching of his Word to others, or only to preach, and to put the charge of praying to others; but enioyned them to doe the one and the other, as he himſelfe did, without vſing any <hi>Vicars</hi> in that, that they could or ought to doe; as the Diſciples themſelues haue well vnderſtood and practiſed. We haue the wineſſe thereof in the Apoſtles themſelues,
<note place="margin">Acts.</note> in the election of the

<hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> to nouriſh and feed ſo many fat hogges in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vnder colour and pretext of prayer, and of thoſe Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall houres and Maſſes: for I thinke that none of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers and Doctors, did euer allow of theſe fat bellies, and ſuch howlings, and mumbling, and Canonicall houres; nor of ſuch begging <hi>Monks</hi> and
<hi>Friers,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now doth, and that in ſuch great number and diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the one emulating and hating the other, like ſo many Beares and Dogges, as daily experience teacheth vs, and as their owne

            <p>Truly thoſe Locuſts of whom <hi>S. Iohn</hi> makes mention,
<note place="margin">Reuel. 9.3.</note> doe well expreſſe the
<hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> and the <hi>Popes</hi> Clergie-men, for thoſe were engendered of the ſmoake of the pit; ſo were theſe of hereſies, ignorance, and ſuperſtition: they deſtroyed the fruits of the earth; ſo theſe ſpoile the Church and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Common-wealth. And the Frogs mentioned by him in the ſixteenth Chapter and thirteenth verſe, doe well reſemble the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> who feeling the Riuer
<hi>Euphrates</hi> (which is meant by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) to drie vp, beſtirre themſelues with all their might, and are croaking like Frogs in euery corner, labouring day and night to maintaine the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie, and that ſtincking Synagogue of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> But the beſt way and the beſt remedie to correct their ſpirituall fornications, and to learne them to keepe a good diet, and to vſe ſobriety, is (in my opinion) to damme vp the mouth of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and <pb n="151" facs="tcp:14140:80"/> take it quite from them, for if they loſe that, they are all quite vndone. As certaine ſouldiers heretofore anſwered ſome of theſe Bald-pate fathers, who ſaluted them with a <hi>Pax vobis,</hi> Peace be vnto you: they anſwered them, in ſtead of <hi>Amen; Dominus auferat vobis Purgatorium,</hi> Holy fathers (ſaid they) doe you pray that ſouldiers may haue peace; and we on the other ſide pray to God, to take from you your
<hi>Purgatorie,</hi> which is your <hi>Bull-begger,</hi> that you frighten fooles withall: and then you ſhall haue no more to eat, or cloath your ſelues withall, than we now haue.</p>
            <p>To conclude, all theſe ſhaueling <hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> and
<hi>Ieſuits,</hi> are manifeſt hypocrites, and woe and ſorrow will be their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for they pretend chaſtitie, and liue ſodomitically; they ſuffer themſelues ouer eaſily, to be ſnarled by the allurements of the fleſh; and yet they will be accounted holy fathers, good liuers, and the adopted children of Chriſt, forſooth.

            <p>But vnleſſe they reforme their vicious manners and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt liues, I cannot ſee, how theſe men may rightly be called the children and ſeruants of God, and the lawfull inheritors of the incorruptible crowne of eternall happineſſe. How can they excuſe themſelues in the ſight of Chriſt our Sauiour, that diſſemble thus with the world? Doe they perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be Virgins, and ſhall obtaine the incorruptible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of virginitie or chaſtitie, becauſe the world doth iudge them chaſte?

Doe they think, that becauſe they intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into Monaſteries and Cloiſters, that they are able to keepe themſelues pure and vndefiled, and are able to keepe themſelues chaſte and ſpotleſſe?

I vſe their own words, but their deeds are contrary: They ſay they deſpiſe the world, but yet they will not forſake the things of the world; as high titles, good eſtimation, great credi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

They ſay they are not of this world; but yet the pompe, pride and glory of the world, the vanity, wealth, felicity, brauery, and iollity of this earth, and earthly things with daliance, paſtime, eating and drinking exceſſiuely, and other ſenſuall delights and deſires, ſeruing to carnall appetite, they highly eſteeme and magnifie. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they ſequeſter themſelues from the ſecular people (which is moſt vntrue; for they are (I meane the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers,</hi> and ſome <hi>Nuns</hi>) gadding here and there all day long, to beg, and about other worldly affaires) yet their liues are no more holy, but to ſay the truth, their conditions are farre worſe, they haue vowed chaſtity, but who more vnchaſt than they? They name themſelues Virgins, but who more defiled and incontinent than they? How periuriouſly they haue violated their raſh and vnaduiſed vowes of continencie, their owne hiſtories make mention. The artificiall and ſecret places and vaults, to keep their Whores and Concubines in, many places of <hi>England</hi> doe plainly teſtifie to vs all, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent violatours of their profeſſed vowes, and abuſers of the people, in cauſing them to beleeue that they were the chaft and vndefiled members of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But truly it had beene a happy thing that there had neuer beene either <hi>Monk, Frier, Ieſuite</hi> or <hi>Nun</hi> in the world, as by theſe <hi>Rithmes</hi> written by one of their owne ſect appeareth:

            <p>What is their liues, but Phariſaicall, iniurious, laſciuious, lecherous and Sodomiticall? They talke of heauen, but they walke not to heauen. They brag of <hi>Chaſtitie,</hi> but they keepe Concubines, or elſe doe much worſe: they defile themſelues one with another. They ſpeak of
<hi>Iuſtification</hi> by good works; but they haue no good workes, but vice, as Sodomie, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, fornication, fraud, tyrannie, ambition, couetouſneſſe, and all vncharitableneſſe: They talke of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> but haue no experience of him, nor any acquaintance with him: They honour him with their lips, but their hearts hunger not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him: outwardly they profeſſe him, but inwaardly they paſſe not for him: In the hearing of men they forſake the world, but in the ſight of men they embrace the world. Theſe fat bellied <hi>Monks, Friers, Ieſuits,</hi> and
<hi>Nuns,</hi> ſay that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake <pb n="155" facs="tcp:14140:82"/> the world and the concupiſcence thereof, but they carry it with them into the Monaſteries, for without doubt, it is not poſſible to ſee the world better than in the Monaſteries, where a man ſhall behold nothing elſe, but affections and paſſions of minde, quarrels, diſcords, ambition, pride, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and the like. Oh that men will ſuffer themſelues to be thus mocked and deluded by theſe Frierly ſhauelings, that endeuour as much as they may, in deceiuing the people with their counterfeit holineſſe, to liue like <hi>Epicures,</hi> and to bee eſteemed like Lordlings. Oh that men ſhould credit theſe Phariſaicall hypocrites, that more regard the pampering of their bodies, than the ſaluation of the ſoules of men; which is the end of our hope and faith, yea, the very end of our life in this life. Oh that men cannot ſee how they fight againſt the Goſpell, and ſeeke to ouerthrow faith, with ſuperſtition, couered with the cloake of true piety. Why do not men open their eyes and perceiue, how theſe Maſſe-mongers daily ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to inuent and finde out ſome new toy or bable, therewith to draw the common people vnto them, who are ſo ſimple and ignorant, that they are ſtraight way bewitched with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry new fooliſh and apiſh Ceremony, that theſe Iuglers repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to their view? What <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is he, that ſeeth not their hypocriſie, that vnderſtands not their fraudulent ſuperſtition, wherewith the fooliſh people is inueigled? Is there any but blinde buzzards, that thinke, that to weare the weed or habit of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> or to goe cloathed in that colour, is good againſt the <hi>quartane ague,</hi> and other diſeaſes, and to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in that habite, is the right way to goe to heauen? And therefore the Emperour
<hi>Charles</hi> the fitt, and his ſonne, that ambitious King <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Count of <hi>Arrenbergh,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Albertus</hi> of <hi>Carpi, Rodulphus Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola, Longolius,</hi> a Noble
<hi>Roman,</hi> and many other great perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages haue beene perſwaded by the <hi>Franciſcan Priers,</hi> to die in Saint <hi>Francis</hi> his frocke. But what need I to vſe ſo many words? Theſe <hi>Monks, Friers, Ieſuits</hi> and Popiſh <hi>Prieſts</hi> are come to that point, with that opinion of holineſſe, that they haue rid themſelues out of all other mens hands and aurhori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and haue brought all other men vnder their feet. They <pb n="156" facs="tcp:14140:83"/> know not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom the Goſpell doth plainly ſet forth vnto vs, which they keepe in priſon. And ſince they only had the handling of the booke of peace and libertie, the common people thought they had taken all their doctrine out of that booke, and with curſed and abominable lyes, they take out here a peece, and there a peece, and with ſtrange and fearfull falſe miracles, and fained dreames of
<hi>Purgatory,</hi> they keep the people in ſo great feare and awe, that they are conſtrained to beleeue their blaſphemous and wicked lyes and deceits. And withall, if we conſider their lawes, and the waight and heauie burthen they lay vpon mens ſhoulders, we may truly ſay, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> law is farre more eaſier than theirs. Thus haue they turned Chriſtian liberty into ſlauery and bondage, worſe than that of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> if worſe could be.

            <p>Take patience a while, and hearken vnto one that wiſheth your welfare in the Lord, and one who hath nor will relate vnto you any thing which ſhall be vnreaſonable, but wholly to your aduantage and profit.

            <p>The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſeeing himſelfe inriched with the ſpoiles of other Kings and Princes, not contenting himſelfe with the prey, imagineth that it ſhould ſerue him but as a Ladder to mount to the top of an abſolute Monarchy. And being as it were drunke with the greatneſſe of his happy ſucceſſe, he beganne to plot higher attempts in his ſpirit, as ambition neuer wants matter, propoſing <hi>England</hi> for the marke of his other enterpriſes; but knowing well that hee might not attempt openly vpon it, and that herein force of armes might turne rather to his damage than profit (as it did in the yeere 1588. and likewiſe in the latter end of Queene
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne, when he ſent forces into <hi>Ireland</hi> to ioyne with the Rebell <hi>Tyrone</hi>) he reſolued to follow the aduice of
<hi>Liſander;</hi> namely, <hi>Where the Lions skin is not ſtrong enough, to patch it with a peece of the Foxes.</hi> But then he imagined that nothing could more ſecurely, and more ſoone eleuate him to the top of this greatneſſe than a forcible Ladder of gold, vnderpropped with a more than
<hi>Punick</hi> ſubtilty, and masked with a falſe ſemblance of integrity and religion.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all he had a recourſe vnto a company of cunning
<hi>Magicians</hi> who had beene ingendred here in <hi>England,</hi> and other places of our Kings Maieſties Dominions, but brought vp, trained, and inſtructed in the proud and Magnificent Palace of <hi>Rome,</hi> at the foot of the ſonne of <hi>Perdition,</hi> or in ſome other of his
<hi>Seminary</hi> Colleges or Cloiſters: whom hauing furniſhed in abundance with all that was requiſite for <pb n="159" facs="tcp:14140:85"/> for their affaires, recommending vnto them all his deſignes (but with this <hi>prouiſo,</hi> that they ſhould eſpecially keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues diſguiſed, and lurke vnder the maske of the Catholike Religion) then he preſently ſends them into <hi>England.</hi> And theſe are thoſe miſchieuous and traiterous brood which you call the <hi>holy Fathers the Ieſuites:</hi> a name truly fatall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to euery well ordered Monarchy and Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sorcerers, together with a whole regiment of <hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> and <hi>Seminary Prieſts,</hi> as their Coadiutors and fellow-helpers, were preſently receiued and entertained with great applauſe, of you and all others the <hi>Partakers</hi> and
<hi>Pentioners</hi> of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who leaue nothing vndone that they make themſelues plauſible vnto you and your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers.</p>
            <p>Now theſe traiterous <hi>Ieſuites, Monks, Friers,</hi> and
<hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prieſts</hi> (who aime at nothing elſe than to corrupt the fidelity of <hi>England,</hi> and to withdraw the hearts of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſubiects from their obedience to their Soueraigne; yea finally, to plucke
<hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> from due ſubiection to his Maieſty, and to preſent them to this ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Philip</hi> of

            <p>Theſe cunning <hi>Iebuſites</hi> (or if you will
<hi>Iudaiſts</hi>) are the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> trading Factors and Diſpenſers, to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <pb n="160" facs="tcp:14140:86"/> and pay his gold to his
<hi>Pentioners</hi> that lurke about the Court of <hi>England;</hi> ſo that by this meanes he hath ſtill no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and intelligence of the eſtate of the Realme, and withall they ſeduce the ſubiects, as <hi>Cambyſes</hi> heretofore eſpied and deceiued the <hi>Ethiopians.</hi> Theſe I ſay (by meanes of their mercenary tongues) omit no art that may ſerue their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſuborne <hi>England,</hi> but vſe all meanes poſſible to make his Maieſty odious vnto her, and him vnto his ſubiects, in altering (as much as in them lieth) by their flattering diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, the ſincere amity and faithfull loyalty which Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh men haue alwaies intirely borne towards his Maieſty and his Anceſtors: either aggrauating euery ſeeming petty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection aboue his great perfection, blaming and accuſing his gouernment: or elſe in attributing vnto the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> the glory onely due vnto our Royall Soueraigne; and withall, in all their Diſcourſes, magnifying the greatneſſe and vertues of this ambitious Spaniard, whom they paint out accompliſhed with all the perfections that may be imagined; and briefly, they forget nothing whereby they may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw <hi>England</hi> (if they could) from her King, and withall gull you of your money, to enrich themſelues and their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, Cloiſters, and Seminaries, in thoſe forraigne parts.</p>
            <p>But ſome <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> or one of that faction (perchance) may obiect, that nothing moueth the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to be at ſuch great charges, to maintaine ſo many Engliſh <hi>Seminaries, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,</hi> and <hi>Cloiſters</hi> in thoſe forraigne parts, and to tranſport from thence ſo many <hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> and other religious men into the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Dominions, but onely to conſerue among you the Catholike Religion. <hi>Ah poore ſenſeleſſe ſoules;</hi> for Gods ſake giue eare to what I ſhall briefly recount touching him and his Predeceſſors actions in this point, and then you ſhall plainly perceiue whether the zeale that he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth towards your Religion ſolliciteth him to be ſo charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you vnto as you imagine. Hath this great King, or his Father, or Grandfather, ſpent their treaſures, or hazzarded the liues of their ſubiects, onely for the aduancement of the Chriſtian Faith againſt vnchriſtian Princes? nothing leſſe. To verifie this to be true, I will produce you theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: <pb n="161" facs="tcp:14140:86"/> Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. propoſing himſelfe to the aid of certaine Chriſtian Princes, to make an enterpriſe vpon the <hi>Perſian,</hi> for the augmentation of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted that ambitious <hi>Philip</hi> King of
<hi>Spaine</hi> (this Kings Grand-father) to giue him ſome ſuccour, which he not only flatly denied, but which is more, would not lend any of his Gallies, albeit the holy Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> offered to charge them at her owne charges.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, how dealt he with the late King of <hi>Portugall, Don Sebaſtian,</hi> whoſe death all Chriſtendome had ſufficient cauſe to bewaile: who (deſiring to aſſiſt <hi>Mulei Mahumet</hi> King of
<hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> againſt <hi>Mulei Maluco</hi> his brother, who had expulſed him his Realme, a worke ſurely worthy of ſo noble a Prince, and aduantagious beſides to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the good conditions he had compounded with the ſtranger) required <hi>Philip</hi> his Vnkle to ſuccour him in that expedition; who accorded, that hee ſhould haue fifty Gallies equipped, and foure thouſand fighting men: which <hi>Mulei Maluco</hi> the other brother perceiuing, incontinently offered <hi>Philip</hi> certaine Townes on the Sea ſide to deſiſt from his promiſe; which he ſpeedily accepted, not ſhaming to breake his oath ſworne to his Nephew, to contract alliance with a barbarous Infidell: ſo much did auarice raigne ouer him, as to cauſe him to violate the Lawes of God and men: but he was paid with the ſame mony that he lent, for ſending his Ambaſſadour
<hi>Vanegas</hi> to take poſſeſſion of the Towne of <hi>Rarach,</hi> and others promiſed vnto him: the <hi>Barbarians</hi> mocking at his treachery and perfidiouſneſſe, conſtrained the Ambaſſadour by force of the Cannon, to retire ſooner than he was willing. But it may be you will ſay he bare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe politikely in theſe two actions, to conſerue and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his owne eſtate, as if humane policy were to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Law and honour of God. I but for all this, he hath ſhewed himſelfe a very zealous Catholike, and hath carried a particular reſpect towards tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e that make a ſtrict profeſſion of his owne Religion: well, but let vs ſee if that be true. After that he had inuaded the Kingdome of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi> and that among infinite other Ladies, he had baniſhed <pb n="162" facs="tcp:14140:87"/> into <hi>Caſtile</hi> the wife of the <hi>Agent</hi> of <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King thereof, his children, and Mother in Law; he drew three of his ſiſters, chaſte and religious <hi>Nunnes,</hi> out of the Monaſtery of Saint <hi>Clare</hi> at
<hi>Lisbone,</hi> and confined them likewiſe into <hi>Caſtile.</hi> But he hath dealt maruellous merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with them in ſauing their liues, albeit ſeruile and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Yea, but ſith the women are thus dealt with, the men muſt be handled a little more rigorouſly, and ſurely herein he hath thorowly acquitted himſelfe, witneſſe a religious <hi>Frier</hi> named
<hi>Iohn,</hi> of the Order of Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> who for embracing the liberty of his Country, was hanged in the Ile of <hi>Madera.</hi> Another
<hi>Frier, Hector Pintus,</hi> of the Order of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> was committed to the hands of certaine ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> where he was afterwards impoiſoned. <hi>Frier Iames de Noronba,</hi> another
<hi>Dominican Frier,</hi> and brother to the Earle of <hi>Mira,</hi> was ſo cruelly beaten by the ſouldiers (that were of his guard) that he died. A
<hi>Doctor</hi> named <hi>Frier Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> of the Order of Saint
<hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and one <hi>Frier Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel Margues,</hi> a
<hi>Franciſcan Frier,</hi> were both chained toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Rouers</hi> and Theeues in a <hi>Galley,</hi> which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken by the
<hi>Turks,</hi> vnder whoſe crueltie, I leaue it to your Iudgement to imagine, what torments theſe two Friers ſuffered. Frier <hi>Gregorie</hi> of the Order of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> was alſo captiuated in the Gallies.
<hi>Lewis Soarez</hi> a <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Frier, hauing been tortured with a thouſand torments in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was afterwards baniſhed. And Frier
<hi>Anthony Senenſes,</hi> was conſtrained to lurke ſecretly in hills, woods, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes, to auoid the bloudie rage of this <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> And briefly thouſands of others, who were either drowned, ſtrangled, empoiſoned, impriſoned, or conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to abandon their naturall Countrey, friends, goods, lands and reuenues.</p>
            <p>Againe, many of them were compelled to flie into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France</hi> and other Countries; who declared the cruell barbariſme of the
<hi>Spaniards.</hi> But for what occaſion, or to what end were all theſe cruelties committed? Becauſe theſe men were true <hi>Patriots,</hi> and knew the qualities and nature of a <hi>Spaniſh Vſurper;</hi> and therefore left they ſhould moue the <pb n="163" facs="tcp:14140:87"/> people to recouer their liberty, hee vſed them thus. I ſpeake not of an infinite number of the heads of their Nobilitie, wherewith the gates of their Townes and Cities were ſtuffed, and repleniſhed daily. Yea, but hee hath fully gratified all thoſe that were fauouring him in the vſurpation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: Surely, according to their merits, and the bounty of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> a people, who moſt commonly loue <hi>Treaſon,</hi> but hate the <hi>Traitors</hi> when their owne turnes are ſerued: Hee made them know, when they demanded recompence for their ſeruice; that albeit they had ſold and betraied their Countrey, yet he was nothing in their debt; and that a man was ill aduiſed, to buy that which is his owne. Behold the faire reward of their treacherie, and the good paiment of their ſale. <hi>Chriſtian Var de Vegua</hi> Gouernour of the Caſtle of <hi>Saint Iohn,</hi> experienced this to be true (although too late) who (for a good annuall penſion promiſed to him, during his life) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered that place to the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and in ſtead of enioying this promiſe, he was incontinently baniſhed for ten yeeres into
<hi>Affrica,</hi> to make warre againſt the <hi>Moores.</hi> And if you deſire to know further hereof, behold the requeſt which thoſe traytors preſented vnto the ſayd King <hi>Philip;</hi> beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him to keepe his promiſe: You ſhall find it in print in the later end of the
<hi>Iuſtification</hi> of <hi>Don Antonio</hi> (the true King of
<hi>Portugall</hi>) touching the warres which he made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame King <hi>Philip:</hi> ſo that if hee left any (hauing chaſed away the reſt) of the Nobilitie or Gentrie, hee and his Succeſſors haue held them ſhort; that they are (as it were) in captiuitie, and continually in danger of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which is as bad (if not worſe) than vnder the
<hi>Turks</hi> captiuitie.</p>
            <p>Were theſe the effects of a King, terming himſelfe ſo great a <hi>Catholike?</hi> was this the reuerence he beareth to the holy
<hi>Apoſtolike See?</hi> was this to ſhew himſelfe <hi>The ſole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and Pillar of the Chriſtian Church,</hi> as he impudently vaunted in his titles? Was this to be the true <hi>Paſtor</hi> of the people, as
<hi>Homer</hi> writeth of the Prince <hi>Agamemnon?</hi> is this to be like the good Houſholder? was this to vanquiſh his will, to handle thoſe rigorouſly, whom he had conquered by force of armes? No, no: and therefore as
